I know that Wetherspoons aren’t the classiest pubs but their menu caters to the most dietary preferences, so we’ll be returning to ‘spoons in November.

12/01/2020, 15:42 - Richard Hurst: Guys I'm really gutted but I'm gonna have to pull out. I've been awake since 5:30am Friday and done two shifts at work and dj'd at dark matter last night. Most unproductive day ever. Been passing out at my desk. I don't think I can keep going so will head home and crash. Really gutted to miss this

12/01/2020, 16:17 - Vanessa: Xoxo 🤗😘😂
12/01/2020, 16:20 - Gav-Techno: Talking of sleep...
Maya & I fell asleep early afternoon, now she has to go catch a flight and also didnt realise till just now Holborn is some how an hour away even though I live in Zone 2 (SE) so I'm being 💩 and not coming either 😬 hate myself. Going to do some work instead.
Maybe Raver Dinner would suit even more people than the 1pm vs 3pm debate..

12/01/2020, 20:05 - Christiana-techno: Guys I am so sorry I  missed it today! 🙈🙈🙈 Just realised what day and time it is. Went to dark matter yesterday and straight after took some family staying over at mine to the airport. By the time I got home after 1pm I could only think of my bed!

17/02/2020, 18:12 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: Hey you all! Hope the WU on Friday was as good as I was hoping.
Just to let you all know, 29th I'll be starting early (friend's b'day) and ending late, 1st morning. I'm happy to join you guys late in the day at Penderel's Oak, (where we have gathered in past Sundays as well). Requires no reservations, ample of space, and quiet enough to chat away. I'm also book for a 7:00pm same day, elsewhere so won't stay late.
17/02/2020, 18:12 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: Whoever turns up first, grab a table, and text to let us know! Cheers! 🤗😌
24/02/2020, 17:59 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: Just checking with you all....how many confirmed for Sunday...say after 3:00pm?
24/02/2020, 18:05 - +44 7539 001890: 🙋🏻‍♂
24/02/2020, 19:01 - Chris-techno: I cant as my parents are visiting
24/02/2020, 19:17 - Christiana-techno: Flexible with the time
24/02/2020, 20:55 - Richard Hurst: I'm bloody working again but can come after if you still out
24/02/2020, 21:26 - Anastasia: I’m flying back to London over the weekend, so I think I will make it
24/02/2020, 21:26 - +44 7968 472333: My intentions are to be there 👍🏻
24/02/2020, 22:10 - +44 7539 001890: Looking forward to seeing you all! 🤗
26/02/2020, 10:47 - +44 7539 001890 added Avi
26/02/2020, 10:48 - +44 7539 001890 added Sienna
27/02/2020, 19:53 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: Guys...I should be able to make it by around 4:00-5:00! 😉👋🏼
27/02/2020, 20:03 - +44 7539 001890: I’ll be there at 3pm for anyone who can join then 🍔
28/02/2020, 20:59 - +44 7394 790772: Hi ravers, any one going to this gig?
Is it good?
https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/the-heartless-daytime-party-tickets-80238149465?ref=eios
28/02/2020, 22:06 - +44 7394 790772: Maybe it’s best to avoid until the covid19 is over?
28/02/2020, 23:07 - Gav-Techno: I want to get Corona virus. Get it over with. 80% of people experience 0 symptoms
28/02/2020, 23:08 - +44 7968 472333: 20% of the time it works everytime
28/02/2020, 23:08 - Gav-Techno: 14 % tickles
28/02/2020, 23:08 - Gav-Techno: 1% (max) kills you
28/02/2020, 23:09 - Gav-Techno: 5% is like a cold
29/02/2020, 03:43 - Richard Hurst: yep. Get cured before the influx of too many sick come rolling in
29/02/2020, 08:04 - +44 7539 001890: Based on what I’ve read, the virus has up to a 14 day incubation period and 80% of people experience mild symptoms so it’s possible that it’s much more widespread than we think. I also don’t think there’s need for any serious concern. The most we can do is use common sense and take precautionary measures when necessary. 
https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/common-questions/
29/02/2020, 08:08 - Callum: It's not chicken pox! You can catch it more than once.
29/02/2020, 09:06 - +44 7394 790772: My company banned international travel (115,000 people)
29/02/2020, 09:16 - +44 7539 001890: Makes sense as a business decision given the spread of the virus and the fear it’s inducing.
29/02/2020, 12:30 - Richard Hurst: but when too many people get it at once, that's when people start dying as not everyone will get the treatment needed in time
29/02/2020, 12:44 - +44 7539 001890: As far as I know, there is no real treatment for it, just like there is no treatment for the cold.
29/02/2020, 20:03 - Gav-Techno: This message was deleted
29/02/2020, 20:04 - Gav-Techno: The "should we panic?" question I keep seeing everywhere recently....

How ridiculous. Of course not.

Even if there was a nuke inbound and lasted with smallpox you still should not spend your last minutes panicking, literally doesnt help anything.
29/02/2020, 20:05 - Gav-Techno: *lased with
29/02/2020, 20:05 - +44 7739 664964: There’s talk that people who work in my building will be ordered to work from home next week (we have been told to have our work laptops with us). Which is understandable, given the circumstances. I do, however, believe that this is massively blown out of proportion. But maybe it’s just me being a lawyer and not believing anything!
29/02/2020, 20:10 - Gav-Techno: It is. The reality is we should do this self isolation with cold and flu, but there would be no economy if we did.
I had the worst cold in years last week - 6 days in bed only getting up for water or toilet.
I'll take corona virus over that
29/02/2020, 20:12 - Gav-Techno: This is not at all like the deadly Spanish flu of 100ish years ago
29/02/2020, 20:17 - +44 7739 664964: Also, not that I am into conspiracy theories or anything, but this is not the first time that they find some deadly virus that is going to wipe out the human range (avian flu and swine flu come to mind). After a few months of panic, a vaccine appears as a miracle, the governments pay huge money (form tax payers) to purchase it and distribute worldwide...everybody is happy!
29/02/2020, 20:19 - +44 7739 664964: And based on this document like 10,000 people died in the UK last year of a simple influenza - https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/839350/Surveillance_of_influenza_and_other_respiratory_viruses_in_the_UK_2018_to_2019-FINAL.pdf
29/02/2020, 20:19 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: Massively blow out of proportion! 😌
29/02/2020, 20:29 - Gav-Techno: If quite like to go on holiday, but I'm not because I'm concerned about being stuck somewhere bored shitless in quarantine.
01/03/2020, 10:00 - Callum: Gav it sounds like you don't understand this virus at all and I'm going to enjoy reminding you of this conversation in a couple months when it gets worse 😜
01/03/2020, 10:00 - Callum: You sound like that guy on the cruise ship who said it's not that bad and "he doesn't believe he has it" (he'd already been diagnosed with it) - he's dead now
01/03/2020, 10:00 - Callum: Like sure, don't panic. But also, definitely take measures to prevent it spreading
01/03/2020, 11:44 - +44 7539 001890: *Raver Lunch is today at 3pm*
Penderel's Oak
283-288 High Holborn, WC1V 7HP

01/03/2020, 14:18 - Gav-Techno: School me, what's the death rate..
01/03/2020, 14:19 - Gav-Techno: Giggles and 2 after parties
01/03/2020, 14:29 - Christiana-techno: Call me lame, call me weak, call me a quitter but I need to catch up with some sleep. Only managed to get home now🙈
01/03/2020, 14:41 - Callum: 16 times more than the normal flu, which according to you killed 10,000 people in the UK last year. It also has a much higher virility which means it spreads quicker and more effectively
01/03/2020, 14:47 - +44 7539 001890: Callum and I are here!
01/03/2020, 14:47 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: 15:30-ish...😑

04/03/2020, 10:11 - Callum: another vote for the burger place - the menu looked too great but i was too hungover to actually eat anything
04/03/2020, 10:28 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: My friend invented a new word, that I think is useful, rolls off the tounge easily and should become a common English word:
"Freingling": _When out and about in the company of some friends, and mingling with others_
Usage: 
"So....what were you up to yesterday?"
Possible responses:
"I was with family"
"I met with some friends"
"I was having loads of sex"
Or
"I was freingling"
04/03/2020, 10:33 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: This response would clearly lead to additional questions...like:
"Oh really?! How interesting! So who were the friends and who were the flirts?"....for example...
04/03/2020, 10:34 - Callum: Shin u crazy
04/03/2020, 10:35 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: To which someone like me might say..."Oh well, was a bit drink... swapped t-shirt+tie+jacket with a pretty acquaintance...right in front of a full packed restaurant...lucky they didn't kick us out"...🤦🏻‍♂️😬

*Next Raver Lunch*
Sunday, 29 March at 3pm
Haché Burgers Holborn
95-97 High Holborn, WC1V 6LF
https://goo.gl/maps/xR5ButLrGkh1Gyhg6

I'm not making a reservation this time because who knows who will actually show up on a Sunday🤷🏻‍♂😂
05/03/2020, 11:45 - Isis E. Báthory: I am up for it, they have good food😊
05/03/2020, 12:45 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: Gav and Maya would ...for sure! 
🙄
05/03/2020, 14:36 - Gav-Techno: Alright alright
05/03/2020, 14:37 - Gav-Techno: I have been on the tube twice today, and put my oyster card in my mouth to hold it.
So I probably got corona now
05/03/2020, 15:43 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: Should I stop ordering fresh oysters at restaurants now? 
😂🤣
05/03/2020, 15:52 - Isis E. Báthory: This message was deleted
16/03/2020, 08:35 - +44 7539 001890: Good morning, ravers. I wanted to share this as I now feel that UK and especially London isn’t doing nearly enough to flatten the curve of this virus. I was just reading this article that said this is *the* week to practice social distancing. It’s US focused but I think the same rules apply everywhere. No public gatherings of any size should be happening, all schools should closed, and we need to avoid going to public places. Please take care of yourselves and each other.

16/03/2020, 08:37 - Isis E. Báthory: 😷
16/03/2020, 08:38 - Vanessa: 🤗thanks for sharing Joshua! I will distance myself and take the measures other countries are already practicing! Only go out if you absolutely have to!!
16/03/2020, 08:41 - +44 7968 472333: I think I am with you on this Joshua 👍🏻
16/03/2020, 08:46 - Angel-techno: Thank you Joshua, stay safe everyone
16/03/2020, 08:54 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: Why is using masks, no-hugs/handshakes not enough?
16/03/2020, 08:56 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: A good percentage of healthy adults could already be carriers/immune ...🤷🏻‍♂️ What does self quarantine achieve, except to check if the symptoms show up?
16/03/2020, 08:56 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: Give away free masks at tubes. 😷
16/03/2020, 08:56 - Isis E. Báthory: 😂😂
16/03/2020, 08:57 - +44 7394 790772: I am working from home (I am grateful I can do it) even if my company isn't enforcing it and have cancelled all face to face meetings. 
Even if healthy you can carry the virus and pass it onto someone who has someone at risk at home.
Stay safe everyone 🙌
16/03/2020, 08:58 - +44 7394 790772: 🙌
16/03/2020, 08:59 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: You pass it on by contact (so just don't) and breathing out (so use 😷)..
🤷🏻‍♂️
16/03/2020, 09:00 - Gav-Techno: This is quite the issue in busy supermarkets, as I experienced yesterday 4pm... but yes I know dont need to go again for 10 days
16/03/2020, 09:03 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: 😬 I went to Waitrose yesterday....long queues at checkout so I ask a woman what's the matter...they told me it the panic due to the virus....🤦🏻‍♂️🙄
I had only two items in my hand...droped them right there ..came back home...
General public == idiots.
😆😅😂😂
16/03/2020, 09:04 - Richard Hurst: Because people cough and don't cover and this gets on to surfaces you then touch and then touch your face and infect yourself and then take it home to the ones that will be more effected by this
16/03/2020, 09:04 - Gav-Techno: I think the reality is actually) if too many of us stay in and do nothing, the economy gets fucked, and the virus returns next winter due to not enough people having immunity, and any vaccine is 18 months away minimum.
16/03/2020, 09:04 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: Went back this morning....was just me in the store...
16/03/2020, 09:05 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: True, so free masks from gov...😷
16/03/2020, 09:05 - Callum: Mask doesn't always help :)
16/03/2020, 09:05 - Gav-Techno: You can pass it on just talking to someone who's a few feet away from you
16/03/2020, 09:05 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: It's the economy! ... *ECONOMY*...
16/03/2020, 09:05 - +44 7539 001890: Human lives are more important than the economy.
16/03/2020, 09:05 - Richard Hurst: Not currently 😬
16/03/2020, 09:06 - Gav-Techno: Yes it can get in via your eyes
16/03/2020, 09:06 - Gav-Techno: My main point was the later part of that message
16/03/2020, 09:07 - Gav-Techno: Dont want it back next winter.
16/03/2020, 09:07 - +44 7539 001890: 👌🏻
16/03/2020, 09:07 - +44 7539 001890: Also, there’s no evidence yet that it’s seasonal.
16/03/2020, 09:08 - Gav-Techno: It's too late already to save the economy, hello global recession.
Hello cleaner air too without si much pollution going into the atmosphere! Silver lining..
16/03/2020, 09:09 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: There is a "dose" that needs to get to the lungs... exposure to eyes...only in high dose, like scratching with infected fingers...
Mask, gloves, wash....should be fine!
16/03/2020, 09:09 - Richard Hurst: People don't do this thou Shin. 
So many people openly cough it's fucking stupid
16/03/2020, 09:10 - +44 7539 001890: I was getting excited about the less air pollution as well, but unfortunately it will be offset by many people using less sustainable  products during a global pandemic. So unfortunately the silver lining but not be as bright as we thought 😕
16/03/2020, 09:10 - Gav-Techno: There's good evidence seeing this level of panic that if there were aliens, the government would definitely hide it.
16/03/2020, 09:10 - Isis E. Báthory: 😂😂
16/03/2020, 09:10 - Gav-Techno: 👽
16/03/2020, 09:11 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: Dangerous only in confined spaces elevators), poorly ventilated locations (shows, cinemas, etc)... lengthy periods (long haul flights)...
16/03/2020, 09:11 - Richard Hurst: Also just because you got it once doesn't mean you won't get infected again. 

Also if it mutates to something more deadly we're fucked
16/03/2020, 09:11 - Richard Hurst: Metals, buttons etc etc
16/03/2020, 09:12 - Richard Hurst: 2 metre space is a lot to avoid someone
16/03/2020, 09:12 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: 😅😅
16/03/2020, 09:12 - Richard Hurst: Especially with London streets. That are now getting pretty empty
16/03/2020, 09:13 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: If you guys are fine today...😌 you're all gonna be fine...🤗😄
16/03/2020, 09:14 - Gav-Techno: I'll get it a few more days then head out round london with my camera for some zombie apocalypse photos 🙂🙂
16/03/2020, 09:14 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: ....I'm using 😷...when in tube. 
Otherwise...💃🏻🕺🏻💃🏻🕺🏻💃🏻
16/03/2020, 09:14 - Gav-Techno: If the streets are dead, I'll still be socially distancing...
16/03/2020, 09:14 - +44 7539 001890: No no no Shin. This is wrong.
16/03/2020, 09:15 - Callum: This is somewhat true but I'd an oversimplification - and there's doctors and nurses who have got sick even with full protective gear
16/03/2020, 09:15 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: 😌... please update me. Thanks
16/03/2020, 09:15 - Gav-Techno: That's flu. This is more infectious
16/03/2020, 09:16 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: Medics are at high risk. Higher than general public.
16/03/2020, 09:16 - Gav-Techno: Like Bruno Mars.
16/03/2020, 09:17 - Richard Hurst: <Media omitted>
16/03/2020, 09:17 - Gav-Techno: You hate it, but it's so fucking infectious
16/03/2020, 09:17 - Callum: But they're wearing masks and gloves and washing hands like you said 😜
16/03/2020, 09:18 - Gav-Techno: Is raver lunch off then?
16/03/2020, 09:18 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: True but they are in contact with primary sources...even the fluid samples...so they are at much higher risk...
16/03/2020, 09:18 - Gav-Techno: Maybe do it over Zoom, cooking lunch yourself
16/03/2020, 09:18 - Richard Hurst: <Media omitted>
16/03/2020, 09:19 - Isis E. Báthory: Sounds like the most sensible thing to do

16/03/2020, 09:26 - +44 7968 472333: I’d get on that asteroid that’s about to go by
16/03/2020, 09:27 - Gav-Techno: Thanks for that I do always wonder what else is going on when this one news item is dominating.

The best news I see there is beauty and staying until 20:36 just give me anything that's stable😄😄
16/03/2020, 09:27 - Richard Hurst: 😅 world's going to shit
16/03/2020, 09:27 - Gav-Techno: Stock markets are all down another 8% today
16/03/2020, 09:28 - Gav-Techno: Welcome to season 6 of Black Mirror
16/03/2020, 09:28 - Chris-techno: This is where we find out we're all in a simulation
16/03/2020, 09:33 - +44 7539 001890: Next Raver Lunch might be online 💡🙂
16/03/2020, 09:33 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: Thanks @⁨+44 7539 001890⁩ 🙂...so it is *slightly* more "virulent"...
16/03/2020, 09:34 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: 😆😅..is this a glitch in the software ...
16/03/2020, 09:34 - +44 7539 001890: *and* has approximately 10x the death rate of flu.

16/03/2020, 09:39 - +44 7539 001890: Death rates apply the entire population.
16/03/2020, 09:40 - +44 7739 664964: I think within a month, we will be back to the Medieval times
16/03/2020, 09:40 - +44 7739 664964: The Black Death killed 1/3 of Europe’s population - I think this will be comparable
16/03/2020, 09:41 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: I'm gonna want to be in bed with the most gorgeous girl(s)...when this gets rebooted....😌
Humble request to the overlords....
*ARE YOU LISTENING?*
😁😆

16/03/2020, 09:42 - +44 7539 001890: And it's important not to assume we're all "healthy ravers." I have auto-immune disease, for which I take a medication that suppresses my immune system.
16/03/2020, 09:42 - +44 7968 472333: Scheisse
16/03/2020, 09:43 - +44 7968 472333: It’s all becoming a bit V For Vendetta

16/03/2020, 09:45 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: 😌🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗
16/03/2020, 09:46 - +44 7968 472333: As humans we thrive on connectivity. This may idea may have some merit....
16/03/2020, 09:47 - Gav-Techno: 😆 it's not that bad. Its 3-4% at the very worst, and mostly people who are already at risk of ill health
16/03/2020, 09:48 - Gav-Techno: Let's do it, how many feeds does zoom support?
16/03/2020, 09:48 - +44 7968 472333: I’m more worried about the asteroid
16/03/2020, 09:48 - +44 7739 664964: I am pretty sure it will mutate very soon, with mortality rate reaching 90 percent, plague doctors on the streets, billions dead and collapse of the human civilisation as we know it
16/03/2020, 09:49 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: Well, I shall mutate as well! 😌😉
Just as rapidly! Stay ahead of the curve...😅
16/03/2020, 09:50 - +44 7968 472333: Allegedly the virus has already mutated when it came to Europe. It had to change to be region 2 compatible like DVDs use to be...
16/03/2020, 09:51 - Gav-Techno: Not this time 😆😜
16/03/2020, 09:54 - +44 7539 001890: I think 100. I look into it 🙂
16/03/2020, 09:54 - Gav-Techno: Coool
16/03/2020, 09:54 - +44 7539 001890: I encourage others to practice more gratitude to help stay sane in these crazy times. 🙏🏻🙂 Here's a short film for inspiration: https://vimeo.com/44131171

16/03/2020, 09:55 - Gav-Techno: Laters.

16/03/2020, 09:56 - Gav-Techno: Maybe when is all over just maybe the world's mentality will change and people will be more grateful and humble and talk to each other
16/03/2020, 09:59 - +44 7739 664964: Well by the end of this crisis there will most likely be no power, no fuel, no electricity, no Internet etc - and anyone who survives will find themselves essentially in the Medieval times
16/03/2020, 10:02 - Callum: 🥳🥳🥳
16/03/2020, 10:04 - Richard Hurst: I really hope it doesn't come to that although everywhere I've traveled in the last week I have seen 1-3 fights or arguements in the streets over this virus. People are scared.

I'm more scared about humans than the virus. We're the problem not the virus 🤦🏻‍♂
16/03/2020, 10:08 - +44 7739 664964: I feel like this is just the beginning I am afraid
16/03/2020, 10:08 - +44 7739 664964: Will get even worse when the world will start running out of food and other necessities
16/03/2020, 10:10 - +44 7968 472333: I think I might order a papa johns pizza this morning while I can
16/03/2020, 10:12 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: True...😌...markets panic, over-reaction...then over-correction...I just got emails cancelling 3 days worth of meetings...🤦🏻‍♂️
16/03/2020, 10:12 - +44 7968 472333: Jokes aside, there are and will be many more learnings on how we have been living and how we will live in the future courtesy of this.
16/03/2020, 10:13 - +44 7968 472333: And then Warren Buffet buys everything
16/03/2020, 10:15 - Richard Hurst: It is.

We dont even have it bad yet but people are going crazy already. 

Will see how we all fairing in 10-14 weeks when they expect this to peak
16/03/2020, 10:20 - +44 7968 472333: May have to bring rations back in if people don’t calm down
16/03/2020, 10:30 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: I know someone who works for Center for Disease Control. She has all the stats and medical info.
She says it's mass histeria... media reporting, alarmist reaction...
Calm gov. 😌 == Back to usual fairly soon
Alarmist gov. 😱 == Armageddon
16/03/2020, 10:35 - +44 7968 472333: @⁨🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine⁩ is it worth buying masks?
16/03/2020, 10:36 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: I don't have any. But I carry a face scarf...I use it briefly if I'm in tube, lifts, etc...
I wash hands frequently...
16/03/2020, 10:37 - +44 7968 472333: Picture?
16/03/2020, 10:41 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: <Media omitted>
16/03/2020, 10:41 - Christiana-techno: 🙌🏽 So the whole world is just over reacting about it?
16/03/2020, 10:41 - Christiana-techno: 😂😂
16/03/2020, 10:43 - +44 7539 001890: Yes, I’m hopeful that it teaches us how to live together more compassionately. 🙏🏻
16/03/2020, 10:45 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: "whole world"...may be not. Chinese quarantine, Iranian/Italian measures...well could be justified.. but stockpile supplies at home? Stop going out to restaurants, malls?, ...meeting people you know are healthy?...I'm not changing my lifestyle...
I'm off to gym soon...just spray my hands with disinfectant...wash after weights, don't scratch eyes/nose...if it does feel itchy, use clothings, back of hand...
16/03/2020, 10:46 - +44 7539 001890: Shin, I’m skeptical that someone who works for CDC is saying it’s mass hysteria.

“The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended Sunday that no gatherings with 50 people or more — including weddings, festivals, parades, concerts, sporting events or conferences — be held in the United States for the next eight weeks, in one of the federal government’s most sweeping efforts to slow the spread of the coronavirus.”

Seems like the CDC is asking others to be quite cautious.
16/03/2020, 10:51 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: Fair enough...we as public are getting all sorts of advice...from "do nothing" to "lock yourselves up".
I'm doing something, but not anything drastic. 😌
I'm hoping the gov. is careful.
16/03/2020, 10:59 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: ....no hugs or oxytocin either...for a few weeks...😉
16/03/2020, 10:59 - Christiana-techno: So @⁨🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine⁩ since you are the scientist here I will bother you with my questions.

Why so much terror about this virus? Its death rate is not even that high, from the data available so far
16/03/2020, 11:02 - +44 7539 001890: 1) Governments and health orgs are asking people to stock on food and supplies in case you need to quarantine. It's absolutely justified.
2) We should stop going to restaurants and bars because most people don't have immunity and even if they appear healthy, they could be transmitting the virus. This is crucially important right now in order to help flatten the curve.
3) Meeting *very* small groups of people should be okay if you practice good hygiene  but there's no way to absolutely be sure they're healthy because the incubation period is 2 - 14 days.
16/03/2020, 11:04 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: 🤦🏻‍♂️🤗🤗..I'm not the expert on this. There's lots out there. I've made "my informed decision". Everyone should do what they think is the best course of action...🤷🏻‍♂️
16/03/2020, 11:07 - Isis E. Báthory: 😂😂

16/03/2020, 12:42 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: *Some additional information*:🙄
Two large pharmaceutical companies will be concluding trials (in 3-4 weeks time) on antiviral drugs for Covid19. These drugs have previously been successfully tested against other vial diseases, coz the molecular mechanisms for disease (and prevention) are identical.
The confidence in one of the companies is so high, they have switched on their manufacturing site in Cork, to prep stocks, ahead of the approvals.  

So...😊 I shall wash my hands, go out as a bank robber and ... chase cowgirls with masks 🤷🏻‍♂️😃🤠
16/03/2020, 12:43 - Isis E. Báthory: 😂
16/03/2020, 12:56 - +44 7539 001890: Anti-virual drugs, while important for the long-term prevention of coronavirus, aren't a feasible solution in the short-term. There is no way they can be produced and distributed fast enough based on how quickly the virus is spreading. Do not depend on vaccines.

16/03/2020, 13:41 - +44 7986 985166: Neither does he🤣🤣 that was my point...I just said I would only believe the 4th story in the metro cuz that is most likely what's happening fr😇🙃
16/03/2020, 13:43 - Chris-techno: Aye 😄 fair play. Although I've heard that something around number 2 is pretty accurate too (although I need citations 😉)
16/03/2020, 13:49 - +44 7968 472333: I’m going to go and test out number 3 for scientific purposes

19/03/2020, 11:28 - +44 7539 001890: Hello dear friends. Now that everyone generally knows where things are heading in the near future, I think we all need to be a little more careful with our mental/emotional health. Being more mindful of what we're sharing here is a part of this. *So I ask that we don't share any negative/alarming/sensationalist news or posts here*. There are many other places where you can share posts like that: your Instagram, Fb, other WhatsApp groups, etc.  Positive/funny/connective posts are always welcome here. Let's look out for each other and use this as an opportunity to stay positive and connected. Thank you! 🙂🙏🏻
19/03/2020, 11:38 - +44 7986 985166: @ Joshua ...when is the next raver's lunch? This weekend?🤔😅
19/03/2020, 11:40 - Gav-Techno: Sunday, online, cooking your own lunch

An Italian hospital ran out of ICU valves. A local biz brought a 3D printer to the hospital, redesigned & produced the valves in a few hours. “At the time of writing, 10 patients are accompanied in breathing by a machine that uses a 3D printed valve.

22/03/2020, 09:28 - Vanessa: can we limit corona focused talks to a bare minimum please. We can obviously talk around how everyone is getting on with it and how everyone is coping and everyone’s great strategies to stay fit sane and busy. However, please no upsetting content. 

Looking forward to seeing you all! 🤗
22/03/2020, 09:46 - +44 7539 001890: Thank you for saying this, @⁨Vanessa⁩. I know it’s very easy to talk about this right now, but we can get this information anywhere. Let’s try to use this time for enjoying each other’s company, sharing some fun, and having a laugh, which is what I think we all need more than anything right now. I have some ideas to keep us busy. And no, Shin, it’s not what you’re hoping. 😂

Hope to see many of you at 1pm. Please stay home, make sure you have what you need, and take care of yourselves. 🤗
22/03/2020, 09:53 - Vanessa: Brilliant. Looking forward to your ideas, Joshua 🤩 See everyone at 1pm! ❤️

23/03/2020, 19:11 - +44 7539 001890: I just received an SMS from NHS Coronavirus Service, in which they identified me as someone who’s “at risk of severe illness from Coronavirus.” (I take medication for my Crohn’s Disease which suppresses my immune system.) They advise that I don’t leave home for 12 weeks. 😐
23/03/2020, 19:13 - +44 7539 001890: I'm kind of in shock by all this...
23/03/2020, 19:16 - +44 7968 472333: Stay at home mate. If you need anything urgently and can’t get it online reach out on here and I’m sure we can help you out 👍🏻

23/03/2020, 19:29 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: 😓😬😑...sorry to know that! They've been sending letter to I guess everyone who's at risk.
I wonder if you're 12 weeks starts from today? 🤷🏻‍♂️
23/03/2020, 19:31 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: I think the gov. is totally confused about "start dates"...and also not having a "coming back to normal" policy. 😬🙄
23/03/2020, 19:36 - Gav-Techno: Coming back to normal us a complete unknown
23/03/2020, 19:36 - Gav-Techno: At least we dont have trump saying it'll all be fine, everything over quickly
23/03/2020, 19:37 - Gav-Techno: I think the reality is end of may ish
23/03/2020, 19:37 - Gav-Techno: Will know more by end of April
23/03/2020, 19:37 - Gav-Techno: Need 1 week of cases going down

23/03/2020, 19:38 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: Yup...
23/03/2020, 19:38 - Gav-Techno: It's taking China 3 months to get under control
23/03/2020, 19:38 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: ...or no further increase...
23/03/2020, 19:38 - Angel-techno: Stay safe and well Joshua
23/03/2020, 19:39 - Gav-Techno: We have less control over population so 4 months perhaps... which is 
Feb Mar Apr May
23/03/2020, 19:40 - +44 7968 472333: As you probably already know you can still get 80% of your salary if you are off due to these circumstances. Hopefully you will qualify for this.
23/03/2020, 19:42 - +44 7539 001890: I can work remotely and have already told my company that I want to stay another few months. I was going to leave in mid-April.
23/03/2020, 19:44 - Gav-Techno: Back to the US?
23/03/2020, 19:44 - Marius: stay home and safe Joshua and all will be good
23/03/2020, 19:44 - Marius: not if you are self employed
23/03/2020, 19:44 - Gav-Techno: They are 2-3 weeks behind us.. you'll probably be better off here if your able to stay
23/03/2020, 19:45 - +44 7968 472333: @⁨+44 7539 001890⁩ I don’t know how good healthcare is in the US but I feel people don’t realise how great the NHS is. Perhaps stay here until all of this calms down
23/03/2020, 19:46 - Gav-Techno: Imho the US is going to experience the worst of any country, unless it gets going in India
23/03/2020, 19:47 - Gav-Techno: Apr/May be a bad time to travel there
23/03/2020, 19:49 - +44 7539 001890: Agree. While I can live with my parents if necessary, I have no job or place to live there. I have both here and my company happens to be doing quite well right now.
23/03/2020, 19:49 - +44 7539 001890: 💯
23/03/2020, 19:50 - +44 7539 001890: I’m absolutely appalled by the British government’s response. (US government response isn’t any better but at least some state governments—notably California ❤️—are telling people how to stay safe.) Germany is is the only country in Europe that has responded to this properly.
23/03/2020, 19:52 - Callum: That's what director income protection insurance is for! 😬

23/03/2020, 20:07 - Callum: Even if it does go far enough, it's too late
23/03/2020, 20:07 - Gav-Techno: Its late
23/03/2020, 20:07 - +44 7968 472333: Please excuse my ignorance, how has Germany responded better? Can we learn anything from them?
23/03/2020, 20:07 - Gav-Techno: Not too late to still make a difference if everyone stays in now
23/03/2020, 20:08 - +44 7968 472333: 👍🏻

24/03/2020, 14:24 - +44 7968 472333: Are you sure about contractors? If you are employed through your own ltd company it should work shouldn’t it?
24/03/2020, 14:27 - Callum: no, you can't furlough directors
24/03/2020, 14:27 - Callum: (afaik)
24/03/2020, 14:28 - Callum: but also, it only covers 80% of salary, and most people running a limited company pay themselves in dividends

I'm "asymptomatic carrier" and safe to party with all others who are the same"...😊
27/03/2020, 13:53 - +44 7539 001890: 🤩
27/03/2020, 13:54 - +44 7539 001890: I’m guessing you haven’t been tested?
27/03/2020, 14:10 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: The test shows the "prevalence" of the virus ....meaning Mr Boris was exposed to it, at some point in the past 1-2 months, and has been an asymptomatic carrier, (risking everyone else he came in contact with, up until the mandatory isolation period).
As the test gets administered to a greater number of (important) people, we are going to get an estimate (which is likely going to be around 80-85% based on the epidemiology of the viral family to which this 🤬 strain belongs) of the prevalence in general population.  
At which point...we can all relax! ...
27/03/2020, 14:10 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: I'm keen...if there is a learning in here for me...but I think I have gotten this the right way. 😌

02/04/2020, 11:53 - Isis E. Báthory: You really enjoyed this one😂😂
02/04/2020, 12:07 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: But honestly..who works in the nude? Say they are all in a hot climate region...like Florida. Everyone has Aircon. Say his Aircon is broken....one still goes about the house in shorts.. minimum. Or underwear.
02/04/2020, 12:16 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: The two in the seemingly younger age groups don't appear to even blink...the ones reacting appear to be middle-aged..so it's a bit of 
- conservative upbringing,
- regularity of exposure to nudity, 
- relationship with the person in question, 
- attitude to social norms (uptight or relaxed), 
- sense of humour related to human error
...and also their overall micro-environment of the office group. (Was Mr Ben a senior VP?😆or the janitor)🤷🏻‍♂️
02/04/2020, 12:18 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: Would be hilarious to be there for there next meeting..😆..and Mr Ben is chairing it! 🙄

02/04/2020, 15:38 - Isis E. Báthory: I think it can go either way, for some couples it may impose some (unknown but much) needed space?
Whilst it may bring some strain to other couples?
02/04/2020, 15:39 - Isis E. Báthory: But the same can be applied the couples staying together, cabine fever may get them😂😂

02/04/2020, 22:43 - Vanessa: Yepp
02/04/2020, 22:43 - Vanessa: Not kidding
02/04/2020, 22:43 - Vanessa: I’m not cuddling the cat downstairs anymore

02/04/2020, 22:52 - Isis E. Báthory: Domestic animals can't catch it, don't believe the fake news. That being said if you have pets that you take out for walks, do clean their little paws when you get back home.
02/04/2020, 22:54 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: That is probably correct coz they can bring dirt stuff back in the house...but these viruses are specific to humans...
Even getting chimps help study this virus won't work.. 😐
02/04/2020, 22:55 - Vanessa: I saw articles that cats can give it to each other
02/04/2020, 22:55 - Callum: It's not peer reviewed yet, but: https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/01/cats-can-infect-each-other-with-coronavirus-chinese-study-finds

02/04/2020, 22:57 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: That's probably a different thing...could be happening all the time between cats. ..
02/04/2020, 22:58 - Vanessa: Well I’m not sure though if they can give it to humans
02/04/2020, 22:58 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: 😆...yet another conspiracy..to rid earth of cats! 😄
02/04/2020, 22:58 - Vanessa: I’m just being very cautious
02/04/2020, 23:00 - Callum: "To monitor respiratory droplet transmission, an uninfected cat was placed in a cage adjacent to each of the infected cats. It was difficult to perform regular nasal wash collection on the subadult cats because they were aggressive. To avoid possible injury, we only collected feces from these cats and checked for viral RNA in their organs after euthanasia."
02/04/2020, 23:00 - Callum: This study is brutal 😭😭😭

03/04/2020, 15:07 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: I work for one of the companies that's launching the trials in UK. We have discussions (and some frustrated laughs) everyday - we generally agree that the mandatory 12-week isolation of the "at risk" group would flatten the curve...while the general population would be staying home, for no reason other than political pressure.
03/04/2020, 15:07 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: Algarve..
03/04/2020, 15:12 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: Unfortunately, the gov. has made a decision it won't be able to back out of without either substantial scientific data ( 🤷🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🙄)...or a reversal of popular thinking from other large economies...like Germany.

I asked him:
"The flat is visited by a cleaner once a week. This cleanr, as her job! 😆🤦🏻‍♂️ is exposed to several other households. Also, one of the tenants is herself a cleaner going to work, who knows where!. So how is it, people *known* to your tenants are not permitted?"

08/04/2020, 16:18 - +44 7968 472333: My car is averaging 54.5 mpg for the past 577.8 miles. So I decided to figure out how many miles a full tank would give me (yes I’m bored). 

So I divide 577.8 by 54.5 to see how many gallons I’ve used which is 10.60.

I then look up how many gallons my car has at full capacity and then extrapolate.

Turns out my car has exactly 10.6 gallons as fuel capacity. Weirded out

09/04/2020, 15:26 - Isis E. Báthory: 😂
09/04/2020, 15:26 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: I'm wondering if prisoners can now have facetime, anytime! 🤷🏻‍♂️

09/04/2020, 15:57 - Vanessa: :( do you have a chunk of cheese? You can batter it almost like a Schnitzel 😊

09/04/2020, 15:59 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: Come to think of it...if the prisoners haven't come in contact with any CV, then they can queue normally for their food, not 2-mt apart.
....and they don't have to worry about haircuts! 🙄

10/04/2020, 13:00 - +44 7968 472333: Did anyone see the David Icke livestream on YouTube before it got taken down?
10/04/2020, 13:07 - +44 7539 001890: Who’s David Icke?
10/04/2020, 13:07 - +44 7539 001890: I think we can use this for quiz on Monday: https://myquiz.org/
10/04/2020, 13:08 - +44 7539 001890: Along with Zoom
10/04/2020, 13:08 - +44 7539 001890: On your computer.
10/04/2020, 13:08 - +44 7968 472333: A conspiracy theorist
10/04/2020, 13:08 - +44 7539 001890: What’s his latest theory?

10/04/2020, 13:12 - +44 7968 472333: He can be, but in the midst of all the stuff that comes out of his mouth there is the odd thing that does make you stop and think a little bit
10/04/2020, 13:12 - Gav-Techno: I'm glad I didnt.
Ive watched Brain Rose / London Real on and off for maybe about 8 years now, and Brain has lost it
10/04/2020, 13:12 - Vanessa: I’ve seen it
10/04/2020, 13:13 - Vanessa: But I stopped watching at a certain point when it got too absurd
10/04/2020, 13:14 - Gav-Techno: David Icke talks sense about 20% of the time and has no self awareness the other 80% is just bullshit
10/04/2020, 13:14 - Vanessa: Great! Thanks Joshua for looking into it! Really looking forward to it 🤗
10/04/2020, 13:14 - +44 7968 472333: That’s about the ratio I expect from him
10/04/2020, 13:14 - Gav-Techno: He'll just always says whatever is opposite to MSM
10/04/2020, 13:15 - Gav-Techno: And get it right 1 time in 10
10/04/2020, 13:15 - Gav-Techno: Another 1 in 10 makes sense but not right

10/04/2020, 13:20 - +44 7968 472333: What kind of thing was he saying? It’s always entertaining
10/04/2020, 13:30 - Vanessa: Tbh I can’t even remember at which point I turned it off ... I was listening curiously at first and then got annoyed and turned it off haah
10/04/2020, 13:52 - +44 7968 472333: 😂

11/04/2020, 12:35 - +44 7539 001890: We can do a Zoom tomorrow as well if people want!
11/04/2020, 12:37 - Vanessa: I’m in for whatever you guys want. I’m flexible we could also do the quiz on Sunday tbf no?
11/04/2020, 12:43 - Richard Hurst: I'm up for it. Finally not working

12/04/2020, 13:31 - Richard Hurst: Great. Will join in just a sec 🙂
12/04/2020, 13:33 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: I went to a park yesterday and saw police coming and clearing out people who were just sitting, or picnicking, ...some smoking weed! 😅😆
12/04/2020, 13:39 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: Aren't those "legs"? 😅😂😆
12/04/2020, 13:46 - Richard Hurst: sorry im late. im in
12/04/2020, 19:38 - +44 7539 001890: Hey everyone, I only received three responses to this, which I don't think is really enough for a full on pub quiz. Does anyone else want to join? Also, everyone suggested a different time, so we'd need to agree on that as well. If nothing else, we can simply have a Houseparty call with games?
12/04/2020, 19:43 - Isis E. Báthory: Mikhail and I might join in if it goes ahead😊
12/04/2020, 19:46 - Isis E. Báthory: Any time in the afternoon works fine for us I guess
12/04/2020, 21:16 - Vanessa: I’d have a friend who’d like to join too
12/04/2020, 21:19 - Vanessa: She could do the afternoon slot
12/04/2020, 21:30 - Isis E. Báthory: The more the merrier😁
12/04/2020, 21:30 - +44 7739 664964: Amazing
12/04/2020, 21:34 - Vanessa: Great :) I was hoping it’s ok
12/04/2020, 22:35 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: Houseparties are fine too! 👍🏼😊

13/04/2020, 11:36 - +44 7539 001890: That was yesterday.
13/04/2020, 11:37 - Isis E. Báthory: 🙈🙈🙈
13/04/2020, 11:38 - +44 7539 001890: Regarding pub quiz, I naively underestimated the time needed to coordinate it with everything else going on for me right now. So options: 
- someone else can coordinate the quiz
- we can do it on HouseParty
- we can just have a regular hang out
- we can cancel quiz and try again some other time

Thoughts?

15/04/2020, 17:52 - +44 7739 664964: Hello lovely,
I hope you’re keeping well during this unusual time that we’re all navigating. 
I’ve been doing my best to keep my spirits high. 💫
I’m reaching out to all of the gorgeous people that I know to share some helpful resources that I’m currently working with. These tools have been such a great help to me and I’d love to share them with anyone in need. 

Every Wednesday at 7.30pm I’ve been hosting a healing and meditation group via Zoom. It’s a space for people to feel calm, clear their mind and lift their spirits. Good vibes a plenty. If you or anyone you know could benefit from a mental and emotional boost then please join us. It’s free during the month of April and you can join via this link:
https://zoom.us/meeting/register/uZEscumhqjwrHg9ckqCR3VWYrb84-W-fJQ 

I’m also offering online 1-1 life coaching and healing sessions. These sessions are a perfect way to heal stress and anxiety, build clarity in your wants, needs and dreams and create practical steps forward to creating a life that’s more fulfilling. If this moment of pause has made you aware that it’s time to create some changes in your life and you’d like some help in making that happen, I’d love to support you moving forward. You can send me a message for a free consultation and chat. 

Please feel free to forward this to anyone who you think this could be helpful to. 
Sending you big hugs and the warmest wishes, V xx 💛
15/04/2020, 17:53 - +44 7739 664964: In case anyone is interested, a friend of mine is running meditation sessions this month. She is really amazing at it, can highly recommend her if meditation is your thing

22/04/2020, 11:31 - +44 7539 001890: Hi, this may be useful to some of you. Zava, the company I work for, has launched a coronavirus testing service, and we've been given a code for 20% off for our friends and family. (Key workers get 40% off.) This test normally costs £135, which includes the cost of running the tests, analysing the results and providing a follow-up appointment with a doctor if you need it. By using one of these tests, the NHS is not losing or spending any of their resources, as we’re only using excess lab capacity. The discount code is ZAVAUKFF. Let me know if you’ve got any questions! https://www.zavamed.com/uk/coronavirus-service.html
22/04/2020, 11:39 - +44 7968 472333: Good to know Joshua. Thanks

23/04/2020, 12:12 - Callum: Does it just test if you currently have it or can it test if you've previously had it?
23/04/2020, 12:16 - +44 7539 001890: If you have it. It doesn’t test for antibodies.
23/04/2020, 12:16 - Callum: Cool thanks
23/04/2020, 12:16 - Callum: Would have been useful three weeks ago for my mum then 😅

23/04/2020, 13:03 - Callum: Fine now! But we think she's where my granddad got it from - and he's less fine 😬
23/04/2020, 13:15 - Vanessa: Oh no :( Did he get tested? Is he recovering at home or hospital?
23/04/2020, 13:18 - Callum: Yea he got tested
23/04/2020, 13:18 - Callum: He was in hospital for three weeks and this morning they've moved him to a nursing home because he's delirious and probably will be for a while
23/04/2020, 13:21 - +44 7968 472333: Sorry to hear that Callum. Hope he makes a speedy recovery 👍🏻

28/04/2020, 10:33 - +44 7539 001890: Thank you for asking, Callum! I feel that I'm doing well most of the time as I work from home and try to get outside at least once a day for a walk. I'm also grateful that I live with my partner and her three children which is filling my days with activity and keeping me on my toes. I know that living alone could make things much more challenging. It's also stressful at times, but I feel I'm growing closer to my partner and growing personally through this experience. Daily meditation has become really important. How about everyone else?
28/04/2020, 10:37 - +44 7968 472333: I’ve named every single tile in the kitchen. Will start on the bathroom next week
28/04/2020, 10:38 - Callum: what are their names?
28/04/2020, 10:38 - Callum: have you painted little faces on them?

28/04/2020, 10:39 - +44 7968 472333: Oooh, activity to do after the bathroom tiles have been named. Thanks dude!

Jokes aside, how’s your grandad doing?
28/04/2020, 10:41 - Callum: he ate a bowl of porridge yesterday 💪
28/04/2020, 10:42 - Callum: he's been moved out of the hospital into a home for at least the next two weeks, then he will either be going home or into a longer-term home
28/04/2020, 10:42 - +44 7968 472333: Hoping for the best for him
28/04/2020, 11:40 - Richard Hurst: I'm doing ok. Have my ups and downs and boredem every now and then. Have spent a lot of money on games haha and going for a run most days. Set my sights on 10k at a reasonable pace. 

WFH also helps to pass the time but definitely have days of motivation and do a lot and other days just staring at the screen 😅
28/04/2020, 11:40 - Richard Hurst: Good to hear your focusing on positive Josh and growing from this 💪🏻
28/04/2020, 11:41 - Richard Hurst: 😂
28/04/2020, 11:42 - Richard Hurst: Hope he continues to improve. Wish the best Callum. 

How are you finding things? What you getting up to to pass the time?

28/04/2020, 11:47 - Callum: i've been baking and cooking a lot, writing a bit, and have started playing minecraft after never gaming in my life before 😂
28/04/2020, 11:47 - +44 7539 001890: Wait, what? First time in two weeks?! It’s been so nice outside!
28/04/2020, 11:48 - Callum: i've been in the garden, but didn't go for any exercise or to the shop or really anything that involved walking more than 200m
28/04/2020, 11:53 - Richard Hurst: Haha of all the games 🤦🏻‍♂️😂

I've done very little cooking with my brother always cooking. His dishes are really good and presents them properly (his a chief). Gonna try and work with him and get some recipes down and make a little cook book 😜

What have you been writing? Stories, code, poems?
28/04/2020, 11:54 - Callum: a lot of the things i cook are here - https://www.notion.so/callumacrae/adfe312dec554387b1b5d2da5838c68c

28/04/2020, 11:55 - Callum: i've been writing an article for my website - which i haven't published anything on in over three years
28/04/2020, 12:05 - Richard Hurst: Nice! All these dishes look amazing
28/04/2020, 12:06 - Richard Hurst: Whats your website on? 
Are you gonna be continuing to create content for it after lockdown you think or good way to pass the time atm?
28/04/2020, 12:12 - Callum: It's my professional website! I'll probably carry on putting content on there when I'm between contracts
28/04/2020, 12:12 - Callum: Anyone else feel like April has passed super quickly? March felt like the longest month ever but April has flown past for me

05/05/2020, 15:08 - Vanessa: Feeling great in my body did a high intensity workout that really got me going had a yummy lunch afterwards and feeling good about myself 😌🥰

06/05/2020, 13:47 - +44 7539 001890: Two monks were arguing about the temple flag waving in the wind.
One said, “The flag moves.”
The other said, “The wind moves.”
They argued back and forth but could not agree.
Hui-neng, the sixth patriarch, said: “Gentlemen! It is not the flag that moves. It is not the wind that moves. It is your mind that moves.”
The two monks were struck with awe.

06/05/2020, 13:49 - Gav-Techno: Well actually... 🙃
06/05/2020, 14:18 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: Interesting!..😉
06/05/2020, 14:20 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: I'm seeing increasing number of people with email signatures that  includ the following:
"Preferred pronouns: She/Her/Hers"
What does that mean?
06/05/2020, 14:22 - Gav-Techno: Is it feminism 2.0?
06/05/2020, 14:40 - Vanessa: That’s part of gender neutrality
06/05/2020, 14:40 - Vanessa: It has nothing to do with feminism
06/05/2020, 14:41 - Vanessa: It’s paying respect to people identifying as trans or don’t want to use pronouns at all
06/05/2020, 14:42 - Vanessa: You can use they their them in a context of writing about someone else if you’re not sure if they (want) to indentify as male or female
06/05/2020, 14:43 - Vanessa: Or if you’re simply not sure if they are
06/05/2020, 14:43 - Vanessa: :)
06/05/2020, 14:43 - Vanessa: We practice that at Adobe and also have gender neutral toilets
06/05/2020, 14:44 - Vanessa: So in this case this person makes sure you know she’d like to be identified as a woman
06/05/2020, 14:48 - Callum: Love a good koan
06/05/2020, 14:53 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: Thanks @⁨Vanessa⁩  😊

06/05/2020, 15:24 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: Also, ...it's not real! 😄😁
06/05/2020, 15:38 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: *Note 216*: Lockdown day 43:
"All the humour seems to have dried up. Introspection feels torturous. Existential thinking is rapidly becoming circular. 
♋ Is fun..😊 few more weeks of that!
🥘 More complex challenges like 3-course meals (with baking, etc). 
🏋🏻‍♂️..naa! Need real weights...proper gym.
Drinking more 🍺. Enjoy the ☀️
📺 Is boring
📚 1-2 hours/day ...being smart don't make us happy 🤷🏻‍♂️"
06/05/2020, 16:01 - Gav-Techno: I'm just in 24/7 bohemian apathy

11/05/2020, 19:27 - Vanessa: 👆So this sounds nice! However I have a few questions... 
where do I get a car from?
Is it a valid option to bring an Uber and have the party with my Uber driver? 😂
And last but very interesting question if I’m not allowed to leave the car how on earth can I stay there longer than an hour or max 2 h (without the urge to find a restroom)
🧐
11/05/2020, 19:46 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: Thanks for sharing! 👍🏼😊 Interesting idea. It's in Bristol.

11/05/2020, 21:45 - ~ Mikhail Kleptsov left
12/05/2020, 07:43 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: Q1: After the Sunday announcement, are you going to do anything different from this week? 🙂
Q2: After the CV pandemic is over, would there be a lasting change in your lifestyle? 🙂

These are two reasonably thoughtful questions. I'm hopeful of some insightful responses.
12/05/2020, 10:53 - +44 7539 001890: Q1: no.

Q2: more time working from home, more time with small groups of friends, more time taking care of myself.
12/05/2020, 10:57 - Callum: 1. no
2. depends if my liver survives this
12/05/2020, 10:57 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: Thanks! 🙂...based on several other responses I got this morning, quite a few are having similar Q2 views.
12/05/2020, 10:58 - Vanessa: Very similar to Joshua’s answer Q1 - I won’t change anything at this point

Q2 - I will invite friends to my home more often, spending quality time with my friends, less consume-driven activities, keep up self care and level of sports activities
Be more selective of how I spend my time according to my preferences instead of trying to please everyone around me
12/05/2020, 11:00 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: 🙌🏼🤗.. thanks! ...very insightful.
12/05/2020, 11:01 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: A _slight_ shift in how people might wanna spend their personal time. 🙂😑
12/05/2020, 11:01 - Callum: oh yea 2. im going to move back to east london
12/05/2020, 11:02 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: 🤷🏻‍♂️😐...
12/05/2020, 11:02 - Callum: what!
12/05/2020, 11:03 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: How has CV19 made you miss east London?
12/05/2020, 11:04 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: Or.. lockdown?
12/05/2020, 11:07 - Callum: it has made me miss my friends, most of whom are in east london. i missed them before when i was living in croydon but this was the final straw!
12/05/2020, 11:08 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: Fair point! 😌
12/05/2020, 11:35 - Christiana-techno: @⁨Vanessa⁩ thank yoy for covering me 100%

12/05/2020, 11:42 - +44 7539 001890: 🎉 I gotta say: never really understood why you moved so far away.
12/05/2020, 11:43 - Christiana-techno: The flat in Croydon is 👌🏾
12/05/2020, 11:43 - Christiana-techno: @⁨Callum⁩ are you moving with your flatmate again?
12/05/2020, 11:43 - +44 7539 001890: Friends > Flat
12/05/2020, 11:47 - Callum: It was an experiment! A failed one 😂
12/05/2020, 11:47 - Callum: Naah need to find someone else to live with
12/05/2020, 11:47 - +44 7539 001890: Anything is worth trying once.
12/05/2020, 11:47 - Christiana-techno: Having your friends nearby to pop for a quick drink or a hello is amazing! But more things come into consideration
12/05/2020, 11:48 - Callum: To be fair, I do like croydon - it has everything, no need to travel to another borough for a specialist food shop or music studio or something
12/05/2020, 11:48 - Christiana-techno: Hahahha What your expectations were?
12/05/2020, 11:48 - Christiana-techno: Too much of a party animal for you??? Hahahha
12/05/2020, 11:49 - Christiana-techno: If it only had better commuting 24/7
12/05/2020, 11:50 - Callum: Why would you need to travel between 1am and 6am? That's too early to leave a party 🤪
12/05/2020, 12:31 - Richard Hurst: East Croydon is 24/7 just not to everywhere 😝
12/05/2020, 12:32 - Richard Hurst: Love your flat Callum. Most insane flat 😎

Do you know where you would move to?
12/05/2020, 12:34 - Richard Hurst: Q1: no

Q2: get out the house more than I do now 😜
12/05/2020, 12:39 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: 🙂👍🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼
12/05/2020, 12:46 - Christiana-techno: You will need to throw one last party with those incredible views before you move!

18/05/2020, 17:00 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: The first episode...why won't she just wait by the pool and let the hitman force the truth from her friend? Instead uses a harpoon. Interrupts the hitman. 🤷🏻‍♂️
18/05/2020, 17:19 - Gav-Techno: Because he was killing him..
18/05/2020, 17:39 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: True, but clearly...the hitman _wont_ kill unless he gets information. And the information (I'm sure would, as the story unfolds), be a link to the next clue. 
So 🤷🏻‍♂️.. a guy with two daughters cannot possibly be pivotal! 😌
She should have let the hitman do the job for her.
18/05/2020, 17:39 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: Well..🙂😊... a few more episodes ..😉
18/05/2020, 18:14 - Gav-Techno: What number are you up to?

29/05/2020, 12:06 - Gav-Techno: Basically socially distance barbecues at home is now allowed, but it's not like the police were going to go knocking on every door smelling like burning sausages

15/06/2020, 16:08 - Callum: turns out the uk is real racist
15/06/2020, 16:09 - Callum: even the people who aren't properly racist are all like "we don't need to solve racism, that's an american thing"
15/06/2020, 16:09 - Vanessa: What exactly was the purpose here?
15/06/2020, 16:09 - Callum: and calling someone racist is apparently worse than the actual racism
15/06/2020, 16:10 - Callum: thugs looking for a fight, but BLM cancelled their protest so they just wondered around london starting fights instead, and fighting the police

15/06/2020, 20:03 - Gav-Techno: I do pay for YouTube. Its 1000% better
15/06/2020, 20:04 - +44 7539 001890: That’s how I Shazam SoundCloud all the time.
15/06/2020, 20:04 - Gav-Techno: Soundcloud would tell you the track name though?
15/06/2020, 20:04 - +44 7539 001890: Glad it’s worth it for you. I don’t use YouTube enough to justify paying for it.
15/06/2020, 20:04 - +44 7539 001890: Not if it’s a mix.
15/06/2020, 20:05 - Marius: found it https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IUUeFYlK88
15/06/2020, 20:09 - Angel-techno: Love that song

17/06/2020, 12:07 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: 👍🏼😊
17/06/2020, 12:08 - Vanessa: I’d love to join but still no sign of the bloody bike I bought so might be not mobile to get there 😒
17/06/2020, 12:11 - +44 7539 001890: Argh seems like everyone is buying a bike right now! 😕
17/06/2020, 12:40 - Isis E. Báthory: I might be able to join
17/06/2020, 13:56 - Richard Hurst: I can't join. Work 😫
Please tell me there will be another opportunity. Work is always getting in the way. What about some time during the week after work?
17/06/2020, 15:10 - Vanessa: Yea so true! Well I’ll keep fingers crossed. Maybe the bike will arrive in time ....
17/06/2020, 15:10 - Vanessa: Richard 🙈
17/06/2020, 15:11 - +44 7539 001890: NoooOOOoooOOOOO Richard!
17/06/2020, 15:13 - Richard Hurst: Please tell me there will be another time. Work are being dicks atm
17/06/2020, 15:20 - Vanessa: @⁨+44 7539 001890⁩ , given the fact it was your officially last day at work. How clear is your last day in London? How far are you with planning?
17/06/2020, 15:21 - +44 7539 001890: I can't book my return flight until I know when my cat can be transported back. They told me they can only let me know 2 weeks in advance. I'm expecting it to be around mid-July.
17/06/2020, 15:22 - +44 7539 001890: However, in my last two weeks here I'm going to be reallllly careful and not do any social activities outside my household because I can't fly if I'm unwell (obvs)
17/06/2020, 15:26 - Vanessa: Ahhh ok makes sense!
17/06/2020, 15:27 - Vanessa: Well time will fly till then I’m sure

17/06/2020, 15:29 - Vanessa: Good point! Sunday might just work fine too for most here. What’s the majority thinking?
17/06/2020, 15:29 - Vanessa: 😭😭😭😭😭
17/06/2020, 15:30 - Vanessa: There are not even gonna be hugs when saying goodbye
17/06/2020, 15:30 - Vanessa: Such a pain
17/06/2020, 15:31 - Vanessa: Otherwise good reason for me finally planning to give the good ol US a visit 😅

17/06/2020, 15:36 - Richard Hurst: I know 😒
17/06/2020, 15:40 - +44 7968 472333: And there was me thinking you might make a decision to stay here permanently. Will try and drop by mate
17/06/2020, 15:41 - +44 7968 472333: It’s been a lot of fun hanging with you on the rave scene 🍭
17/06/2020, 15:41 - +44 7539 001890: Can you cab there if your bike doesn't arrive?
17/06/2020, 15:42 - +44 7539 001890: Yes, please! 🙏🏻 Would love to see you before I fly!

17/06/2020, 15:43 - +44 7968 472333: What if we start a petition to get Joshua to stay? How many signatures will it take Joshua?
17/06/2020, 15:44 - +44 7539 001890: 👋🏻🚨😄 Hey everyone, let's tentatively say Hampstead Heath on Saturday at 1pm. I'll share details of exactly where on the day.
17/06/2020, 15:45 - +44 7539 001890: Awww. I really appreciate that, but it would take a lot honestly. California is my home. 🏡

18/06/2020, 10:17 - +44 7539 001890: Seems like most could also make it on Sunday...
18/06/2020, 10:20 - +44 7539 001890: But I don’t know if I can make Sunday 🤷🏻‍♂️
18/06/2020, 10:21 - +44 7539 001890: I suggest we keep it on Saturday as that’s what we’ve been discussing.
18/06/2020, 10:21 - Vanessa: I can’t anymore - I planned Saturday
18/06/2020, 10:21 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: I cannot...
18/06/2020, 10:22 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: Without a bike? 😁
18/06/2020, 10:22 - +44 7539 001890: Saturday is the day!
18/06/2020, 10:23 - Vanessa: Well I keep cancelling stuff for 20 days bcs I’m waiting on this bike delivery haha
18/06/2020, 10:23 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: Best...to decide a day...and hope many can make it...I might bring along a friend too...loads wanting to get out, and socialize!  😊👍🏼
18/06/2020, 10:24 - Vanessa: Is there a maximum of people to be allowed to come? How many are coming?
18/06/2020, 10:24 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: Are they shipping from EU, or China? Chinese shipments are all delayed...
18/06/2020, 10:24 - Vanessa: EU
18/06/2020, 10:24 - Vanessa: It’s fine Shin. It gets here when it gets her e

18/06/2020, 10:33 - +44 7539 001890: I think max should be 10-15 or so. Seems like 6-8 people so far?
18/06/2020, 10:33 - +44 7539 001890: Wow Shin. Didn’t know that malls were so important to you.
18/06/2020, 10:34 - Vanessa: Ok! 👌
18/06/2020, 10:34 - Anastasia: It’s this Saturday, isn’t it @⁨+44 7539 001890⁩
18/06/2020, 10:35 - +44 7539 001890: Yes this Saturday.
18/06/2020, 10:35 - Anastasia: Great thanks - I will be there
18/06/2020, 10:53 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: No...but *I'm* important to the malls.. 😆😅😂...
18/06/2020, 10:57 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: But jokes aside... here's my approach (not saying anyone else should do the same) 🤗🤗
1. 2m <--> 2m (1m would do 😬)
2. 😷
3. Wash hands
I'm tested clean. I work with NHS. Know of many essential workers...going about their lives. 🤷🏻‍♂️
18/06/2020, 10:57 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: Been taking the tube in May, June.

https://soundcloud.com/kevnull/warehouse-party
19/06/2020, 13:35 - +44 7539 001890: Y’all still on for a picnic tomorrow at 1pm in Hampstead Heath? 😃
19/06/2020, 13:36 - Gav-Techno: 👍🏻☀️⛱️
19/06/2020, 13:38 - Vanessa: Heyyy can we do a bit later? Like at 2 or 3 o’clock? Or is that too late for people?
19/06/2020, 13:50 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: 👍🏼🍻
19/06/2020, 13:51 - Sienna: Yes 😊

19/06/2020, 14:01 - Callum: as much as i miss you all, it's a bit far to travel for a picnic 😂
19/06/2020, 14:09 - Gav-Techno: Nice area
19/06/2020, 14:10 - Gav-Techno: Love Leamington
19/06/2020, 14:14 - Marius: <Media omitted>
19/06/2020, 14:15 - +44 7539 001890: 😂👌🏻
19/06/2020, 14:19 - Gav-Techno: 😄 that looks like a beautiful walk
19/06/2020, 14:19 - Callum: i've cycled it before - most of it is nice (especially the bit through the chilterns), but the bit through west london is grim
19/06/2020, 14:42 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: Try skateboard! 😆😅
19/06/2020, 16:17 - Marius: if weather is nice, I will stay till later
19/06/2020, 16:57 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: You guys night if people can track down a person's location based entirely on knowing their mobile number? 
I don't think it is actually possible for a private person to do that (telecom companies can, Google can) unless specific apps have been installed on the phone that you want a track.
19/06/2020, 16:57 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: *know
19/06/2020, 17:00 - Callum: text them a link, and then if they click on it when connected to wifi you can usually get a pretty good idea of location
19/06/2020, 17:00 - Callum: just have to make it look legit
19/06/2020, 17:00 - Callum: but like, don't do that, that's weird
19/06/2020, 17:00 - Callum: why are you asking?
19/06/2020, 17:01 - Callum: <Media omitted>
19/06/2020, 17:18 - Gav-Techno: "This Stratford upon Avon stay at home mum makes $4367 a week with this trick"
19/06/2020, 18:10 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: I was asking coz someone told me the risk of sharing mobile number with people I don't know well...and I said.. "there's no risk, but educate me if there is a risk"...and they told me that simply by having my number, people can get to know my location...🤷🏻‍♂️
But it's not possible...just received a response from another person...😌☺️...
19/06/2020, 18:11 - Richard Hurst: That person has trust issues 😝
19/06/2020, 18:12 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: Yes true!... actually correct!. Plus no fact checking! 🤦🏻‍♂️🙄
19/06/2020, 18:22 - Gav-Techno: I've had the same number for 20 years, given it out everywhere.

Nobody calls or texts anymore.
19/06/2020, 18:23 - Gav-Techno: This
19/06/2020, 18:29 - Marius: kinda hard to find your gps/ip with only just the phone nr, unless like Callum said, you clicked a random link, or used some dodgy way of comunicate ( sms/phone apps that requires Internet connection)
19/06/2020, 18:30 - Marius: Then again if that guy is a real hacker, may the lord save you 😅
19/06/2020, 18:30 - Callum: Hahahaha I SEE THESE ADVERTS SO OFTEN
19/06/2020, 18:30 - Callum: Not really true usually
19/06/2020, 18:36 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: 🤦🏻‍♂️🙄.  😆😅

27/06/2020, 12:03 - +44 7539 001890: It’s better to have ignore most things Trump says or else you’ll slowly go mad. He can’t be voted out of office soon enough.
27/06/2020, 12:17 - Richard Hurst: Trump gets my blood boiling every time. I just try and avoid news in general now. I do find it funny his slogan was to make America great again when it was already great and instead his tearing it apart 🙄

27/06/2020, 16:11 - Christiana-techno: 🤣🤣🤣
27/06/2020, 16:16 - Gav-Techno: Be prepared so the shock isn't too bad. Thump will probably win a 2nd term.
27/06/2020, 16:17 - Gav-Techno: The only thing that might stop him is this 2nd wave thats just starting.. Talk of that will dominate the news over the next week.
27/06/2020, 16:44 - Callum: Why do you think this?
27/06/2020, 16:45 - Callum: There's no second wave - they're still on their first wave. Why do you think the news will suddenly start talking about it?
27/06/2020, 16:46 - Gav-Techno: Well yes basically still the first one. Things had slowed down a bit but they opened up too fast
27/06/2020, 16:47 - Gav-Techno: A video by Russell Brand. Not someone in favour of Trump
27/06/2020, 16:48 - Gav-Techno: Watch over the next week, let's see

08/07/2020, 16:18 - +44 7539 001890: Wait, you’re showing caution? I’m impressed, Shin!
08/07/2020, 16:24 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: 😅😅...not for the CV19 reasons...but for the my general experience at that venue, the weather, the ventilation...
08/07/2020, 16:26 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: They tend to close the outdoor space ...it can get packed inside...
08/07/2020, 16:26 - +44 7539 001890: Yeah I’m not a huge fan of The Cause either. Inside always felt a bit too much like a dungeon.
08/07/2020, 16:26 - Callum: Possibly they just won't close the outdoor space? 😝

22/08/2020, 18:37 - Isis E. Báthory: Well, I guess you can always have a laugh together at any given moment without necessarily being physically present, whilst finding a time slot for everyone to have lunch, can sometimes be tricky

25/08/2020, 17:57 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: I guess the 50% discount eat-out-to-help-out (which is only on Mon-Wed) is the temptation 🤷🏻‍♂️
25/08/2020, 18:00 - Gav-Techno: 50% off doesn't mean it will take 1.5 hrs to trav though.. 🙃

I'm in Worestershire the week now.. London at weekends
25/08/2020, 18:02 - +1 (415) 351-9231: I'm very happy to see that you're all trying to meet up! ☺️

Daddy is so glad " _to see that we're all trying to meet up and get along_ "

03/09/2020, 16:28 - Gav-Techno: I think its all still illegal raving here Josh - mostly boats & forests
03/09/2020, 16:43 - Isis E. Báthory: It's definitely a risk, the police would rather stop an illegal rave than a manifestation
03/09/2020, 16:47 - Callum: they've been fining rave organisers £10k as of a few weeks ago!
03/09/2020, 16:47 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: Do they ever stop one? 🤔🤷🏻‍♂️
Wasn't there a fine for the organizers?
03/09/2020, 16:47 - Callum: there used to be a £20k fine but it was basically never enforced
03/09/2020, 16:47 - Callum: the £10k one specifically under coronavirus regulations is a lot easier to enforce
03/09/2020, 16:48 - Callum: https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-53964322
03/09/2020, 16:56 - Gav-Techno: Maybe everyone paid £5 to attend 👀

03/09/2020, 17:01 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: 10k fine would be a show stopper...😥

“Mr. Johnson also announced that fines for failing to wear a mask or for meeting more than six people would double to 200 pounds (about $260). Repeat offenders can currently be fined up to 3,200 pounds (not 10,000 pounds as an earlier version of this post said).”

28/11/2020, 02:44 - +1 (415) 351-9231: Small, covid respectful outdoor events are fine but I think large outdoor raves a bad idea right now. I don’t know what WUITW is promoting lately but I would definitely not support that. I realize they everyone has a different risk tolerance, but I think mass outdoor gatherings of more than 50 people are hard to keep safe.
28/11/2020, 10:31 - Marius: I think it was in France
28/11/2020, 10:33 - Marius: Every gig that is going atm in London  is getting shut by the police after 1-2 hours but in a safe and nice manner not like the one in the video above , and yes small gigs like house party's  are a thing now

06/01/2021, 16:01 - Callum: yes, that is generally how stuff that is for the good of society is paid for 🤦‍♂️
06/01/2021, 16:02 - Callum: and if "more regulations" means rolling back trumps changes to the EPA which means american companies can basically do whatever they want to the planet at the cost of our futures, then i am fine with that
06/01/2021, 16:02 - Gav-Techno: I support Democrats 🙂
06/01/2021, 16:03 - Gav-Techno: Watch Trump squirm is better than any movie
06/01/2021, 16:03 - Gav-Techno: *watching
06/01/2021, 16:03 - Callum: then why are you non-ironically repeating republican talking points?
06/01/2021, 16:04 - Gav-Techno: Txt is the poorest form of communication and tone is often lost.
06/01/2021, 16:08 - Gav-Techno: Why do I trigger you every time I speak? 😄
06/01/2021, 16:10 - Callum: everyone triggers me in every message i just only read your ones for some reason
06/01/2021, 16:10 - Callum: it's nothing personal 😆
06/01/2021, 16:11 - Marius: Why do you guys talk politics 🤔🤢🤮?
06/01/2021, 16:13 - Gav-Techno: To be clear, if I was American I'd vote Democrats, but ffs couldn't they find anybody a bit younger.
In the UK I voted to remain in EU, and normally vote Conservative.

Like most people, I normally feel disillusioned with the calibre of all politicians. The best brains for getting shit done are normally found inside private companies, or in specialist scientific fields in universities.
06/01/2021, 16:13 - Gav-Techno: Calum started it this morning 😄
06/01/2021, 16:14 - Gav-Techno: Thats funny
06/01/2021, 16:15 - Gav-Techno: +pretty bored and procrastinating right now
06/01/2021, 16:15 - Callum: why do u not
06/01/2021, 16:15 - Callum: the real reason all your messages trigger me - i guessed u were a tory ages ago 🤪
06/01/2021, 16:17 - Gav-Techno: I have told you that before!
I would say centrist.
I dont like this Tory party. Bunch of inexperienced idiots.
06/01/2021, 16:17 - Gav-Techno: Most of Labour are right now are as well
06/01/2021, 16:17 - Callum: Lol when have the torys ever been centrist in the last 20 years?
06/01/2021, 16:18 - Callum: They didn't even manage it when they were in a coalition with the lib dems
06/01/2021, 16:19 - Gav-Techno: I'm like 51% Tory 49% labour.
06/01/2021, 16:20 - Gav-Techno: </procrastination>
06/01/2021, 16:23 - Marius: Oh well i had enough of politics from when I was living in Romania. 
When you guys will realise that there is no good and honest politician on this planet, all they want is to fill their pockets and be in power, and you as a citizen can't do shit about it, so yeah what's the point talking about it?
06/01/2021, 16:23 - Callum: revolution 2021
06/01/2021, 16:24 - Callum: lets just sack off politics entirely and move to anarcho-communism
06/01/2021, 16:24 - +1 (415) 351-9231: I love you all 🙂
06/01/2021, 16:24 - Marius: Yup, that's the only way to do it, but gluck with that

06/01/2021, 16:25 - Callum: nah, most anarchists think that capitalism will eventually destroy itself
06/01/2021, 16:25 - Callum: individualism can only take you so far
06/01/2021, 16:25 - Callum: _then_ you sneak in and start your own society

07/01/2021, 17:52 - Callum: Looks like that stupid tesla pickup 😆
07/01/2021, 20:05 - Gav-Techno: That's in the background
07/01/2021, 20:06 - Callum: Oh lol its actually by tesla?
07/01/2021, 20:06 - Gav-Techno: Yes
07/01/2021, 20:07 - Callum: Whats the point in it and why do you want it?
07/01/2021, 20:08 - Callum: Or are u just crushing on musk again? 😆
07/01/2021, 20:09 - Gav-Techno: He's got me a deposit on a house
07/01/2021, 20:10 - Gav-Techno: That quad is fully electric, good for the planet and likely an absolute hoot to drive around on
07/01/2021, 20:11 - Gav-Techno: <Media omitted>
07/01/2021, 20:11 - Gav-Techno: Thats 10 years.. ^
the last years been exciting
07/01/2021, 20:12 - Callum: "Good"? Compared to what alternative?
07/01/2021, 20:12 - Gav-Techno: Burning a fossil fuel
07/01/2021, 20:13 - Gav-Techno: Dead dinosaur juice
07/01/2021, 20:14 - Callum: If tesla produced enough to replace all 1 billion cars on the planet do you think that would help or hurt the environment? 😜
07/01/2021, 20:15 - Gav-Techno: I think we should all stay at home
07/01/2021, 20:15 - Gav-Techno: Thats Pretty damn good for the planet
07/01/2021, 20:16 - Gav-Techno: But Yeah if all cars were electric and steam powered by petrol and diesel that would be better
07/01/2021, 20:17 - Gav-Techno: "And steam" = "instead of"

My phone is funny.
07/01/2021, 20:18 - Callum: If the existing ones could be magically converted and batteries magically created without using conflict minerals from the congo that would definitely be true!
07/01/2021, 20:20 - Gav-Techno: https://www.thestreet.com/.amp/investing/tesla-tsla-elon-musk-lithium-mining-rights-nevada

Nevada, not the congo
07/01/2021, 20:21 - Gav-Techno: Saving the transport cost as well, makes business and ecological sense.
07/01/2021, 20:22 - Callum: Sure but they're not actually doing it yet lol (and musk has lied about this before too)
07/01/2021, 20:24 - Gav-Techno: He's trying, more than any CEO
07/01/2021, 20:24 - Gav-Techno: A major car company will go bankrupt in the next 5 years
07/01/2021, 20:24 - Gav-Techno: Too slow to transition to electric
07/01/2021, 20:53 - +1 (415) 351-9231: I just read that Elon Musk is now the richest person in the world.
07/01/2021, 20:55 - Callum: yep!
07/01/2021, 20:58 - +1 (415) 351-9231: 1) That’s not going to happen 2) There’s a very long curve of overall benefits to the planet with more electric cars. Replacing fossil fuel burning cars with cleaner cars (ideally with nuclear) is still better than continuing to use them.
07/01/2021, 21:31 - Gav-Techno: Also one of the smartest engineers
07/01/2021, 21:32 - Gav-Techno: Tesla made 500k cars in 2020.
They will make about 20mil in 2030.
07/01/2021, 22:04 - +1 (415) 351-9231: He also occasionally acts like a dick.
07/01/2021, 22:12 - Gav-Techno: Yep not so great at interpersonal skills
07/01/2021, 22:17 - Callum: I like the bit where he repeatedly invents what is essentially public transport and then gets mad at people for pointing it out

I’m okay! I had a bike accident a couple weeks ago and fractured my shoulder 😛 Managing well overall though. Thankfully I have kind and generous housemates.
20/01/2021, 20:54 - Vanessa: Oh nooo silly Joshua! You need to be careful 🥺

20/01/2021, 21:00 - Richard Hurst: Glad your on the mend Josh. Do you cycle on a road bike or a mountain bike? I dont trust road bike tyres 😝
20/01/2021, 21:02 - +1 (415) 351-9231: Road bike. Road was apparently wetter than I realized and my tires  might need changed too. They’re puncture resistant so they’re less grippy.
20/01/2021, 21:03 - Richard Hurst: I never feel safe on those. One stone is all it takes 😅

30/01/2021, 12:44 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: WhatsApp is end-to-end encrypted. So what's the security issue?
30/01/2021, 12:45 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: Telegram isn't refined 🙄
30/01/2021, 13:43 - Callum: Contacts
30/01/2021, 15:37 - +1 (415) 351-9231: The only security change on WhatsApp is related to using it when communicating with businesses: Facebook will share your data. Otherwise it’s encrypted and they can’t see your chats.
30/01/2021, 15:39 - +1 (415) 351-9231: Telegram is actually worse than WhatsApp in that it doesn’t encrypt conversations by default. You have to make a conversation “secret” for it to be encrypted.
30/01/2021, 15:41 - +1 (415) 351-9231: Signal encrypts everything and is a non-profit. 🏆
30/01/2021, 16:08 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: Does Signal have functions like searching, backups, stickers, emojis, broadcasts, etc?
30/01/2021, 16:12 - +1 (415) 351-9231: Searching ✔️
Backups ✔️
Stickers ✔️
Emojis 👾
Broadcasts (Stories?) ❌
30/01/2021, 16:17 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: So hypothetically, if my dealer's contact list is published by FB or handed to the authority, I'm fucked. 
Hence, QAnon, ISIS, etc should be using Tele or Signal to protect their members. 
But if I'm just having fun and not associated with anything, I got nothing to worry about.
30/01/2021, 16:21 - +1 (415) 351-9231: Also depends on how much you value your sovereignty from corporate greed (Facebook). If you don’t care about that and enjoy being monetized, then sure, use WhatsApp.
30/01/2021, 17:01 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: Signal looks cool! 😃...
But the migration, finding and inviting people...🙄
30/01/2021, 17:03 - Gav-Techno: FB already has my contacts from being on FB.. 🤷🏻‍♂️

09/03/2021, 21:09 - Gav-Techno: This is the bit that absolutely puzzles me
09/03/2021, 21:36 - Callum: (They didn't want out of the news they just wanted the media to stop invading their privacy)
09/03/2021, 21:38 - Callum: If I wanted to put my medical records on the internet, fine, that's a thing I can choose to do. If someone else does it, that's an invasion of privacy.

12/03/2021, 15:59 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: The single biggest positive post pandemic: Work remotely. 
No need to commute to work, 
No need to put up with lowlife work colleagues 😑
No need to bother with office politics. 
😊👍🏼
12/03/2021, 16:03 - Callum: that's the biggest negative for me
12/03/2021, 16:03 - Callum: i am the lowlife work colleague

12/03/2021, 16:53 - Gav-Techno: Think I've found having 2 days a week in the office is good.. no nomad life for me
12/03/2021, 16:58 - +1 (415) 351-9231: Agreed. Not really seeing people during the week can be isolating. Although I don’t think my company is going back to having an office.
12/03/2021, 17:15 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: Pre-pandemic weekdays, after work, I used to head out (on average) 2 evenings...and in weekends had other socializing activities...so if I don't meet people at work... it's perfect. 👍🏼😃

We'll have to be on our best behaviour _all_ the time... 🙄...else everyone will assume we're high....and the social stigma won't just vanish overnight! 😬
23/04/2021, 19:19 - +1 (415) 351-9231: There are no downsides to legalization of pot.
23/04/2021, 19:19 - +1 (415) 351-9231: Fuck social stigma. Be who you want to be!

Check out Mioli Music presents: The Weekender II - Live From Public Works https://www.twitch.tv/miolimusic
24/04/2021, 09:44 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: Well, that's precisely my (personal) concern 🙂🙃. So far, (at work, social meets etc) most people put me under "unconventional, energetic, non-conformist, xxxxx, _whatever_" ...and that doesn't bother me ...but if pot becomes acceptable (like tobacco), then I'm sure someone like me, in formal environments like work places, would just need to be conventional, all the time. 😏😒
24/04/2021, 09:45 - Callum: Good point. CRIMINALISE WEED, PROTECT THE ODDBALLS 🚬🍁
24/04/2021, 09:46 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: No... label it "medicinal"...
24/04/2021, 09:48 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: Sell it at athorized shops...
24/04/2021, 09:51 - Callum: That's… still criminalised 🤔
24/04/2021, 09:55 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: Yes, it's criminal if sold by a dealer. Not if through legit shops.
24/04/2021, 09:56 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: If labeled as 'medicinal' and sold via  authorized outlets, the public stigma would dissolve rapidly.
24/04/2021, 10:01 - Callum: Wait so you're saying to label it as medicinal and then sell it everyone, not just people who have medical needs?

How many of you, when high, have a musical experience that's is out-of-this world? (Same track would normally not provide the same experience).
14/06/2021, 00:06 - +1 (415) 351-9231: Isn’t that what always happens?

30/07/2021, 21:24 - +1 (415) 351-9231: This is a big reason why beloved community is so important to me.

“The Harvard Grant Study, begun in 1938, is one of the longest-running longitudinal research studies of the medical and psychological profiles of a human life. One of the core subjects of inquiry in the study is the question of what creates happiness throughout our lives, and how that relates to what we hold as valuable. All the data and information the study has collected thus far indicates that by far the strongest predictor of happiness is the ability to be in strong and caring relationships. Moreover, in addition to being a predictive indicator of psychological fulfillment, it is also one of longevity and physical health. In our very bodies, hearts, and minds we are programmed to be in relationship and community together.”

23/08/2021, 16:08 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: 😆😅....🙈
23/08/2021, 16:10 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: Did you guys see the security taking one guy out...and calming one guy who had a severe panic attack....both on 2nd night near the food stalls. 😶😑
23/08/2021, 16:08 - +1 (415) 351-9231: Impressive numbers this quarter, Callum! 😂
23/08/2021, 16:17 - Callum: I saw the security chasing the balloon dealers through the crowd
23/08/2021, 16:17 - Callum: Fucked up the crowd for a good ten minutes 😅
23/08/2021, 16:17 - Callum: They were so aggressive!
23/08/2021, 16:21 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: The guy with panic attack - pretty severe case. We could hear his screams from next to the food stalls, while the music was full blast. That's across an open area of about 12-15 meters.
23/08/2021, 16:17 - +1 (415) 351-9231: Did most of you camp in tents? What was the festival infrastructure (toilets, food, etc) like?
23/08/2021, 16:18 - Callum: I camped in a tent, it was fine - small camp site so easy to get back and change clothes and stuff
23/08/2021, 16:19 - Callum: Four showers between however many people were in standard camping (maybe like 80% of 3000 people?) which wasn't great, but eh, who needs to shower anyway
23/08/2021, 16:20 - Callum: Toilets were a bit gross but not super gross - they weren't portaloos they were basically holes into a big pit and they told u to throw sawdust in after you went to stop it from smelling. Disadvantage being that you could see into the big pit 😰
23/08/2021, 16:20 - Callum: I liked it, they did a really good job for their first year
23/08/2021, 16:23 - +1 (415) 351-9231: Yeah showers aren’t a big deal but holes in a big pit for toilets? 😮 I guess that’s par for some WU events but I’d expect more from an event of that size.
23/08/2021, 16:25 - Callum: I mean they were cubicles with toilet seats and toilet paper, but then a big hole
23/08/2021, 16:25 - Callum: Some hipster eco-friendly thing
23/08/2021, 16:26 - +1 (415) 351-9231: Composting toilets?
23/08/2021, 16:26 - Callum: Yea
23/08/2021, 16:29 - +1 (415) 351-9231: Ah… so they did they compost into the ground or did they leave no trace?
23/08/2021, 16:30 - Callum: There were big bucket thingies
23/08/2021, 16:30 - Callum: Feel for whoevers job it is to clean them 🥲

23/08/2021, 16:33 - Callum: https://www.naturalevent.com.au/ apparently it was these people!
23/08/2021, 16:33 - Callum: There were surprisingly few of them, too - and it didn't cause any problems

23/08/2021, 16:49 - Callum: Jesus, that sounds bad
23/08/2021, 16:58 - +1 (415) 351-9231: Was there a wellness / first aid area?
23/08/2021, 17:30 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: One of the DJs played, I think, Breakbeat, the last 30-mins of 2nd night. It was exceptionally good!
23/08/2021, 17:36 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: There were hammocks.
23/08/2021, 17:36 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: Loads of places to just hang out and chill. The day tent was cool!
23/08/2021, 17:40 - Callum: Yes! Psycare were there - I went down there when I was having a bad trip and took a friend down there later and they were really really great
23/08/2021, 17:40 - Callum: It was jungle
23/08/2021, 17:41 - +1 (415) 351-9231: I’m sorry you had a rough trip. What were you taking?
23/08/2021, 17:42 - +1 (415) 351-9231: Hammocks and chill tents sound great.
23/08/2021, 17:42 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: Thanks Callum! 😊
Does anyone here enjoy jungle?
23/08/2021, 17:43 - +1 (415) 351-9231: Sounds like they did a really solid job 🙏🏻
23/08/2021, 17:44 - +1 (415) 351-9231: 🙋🏻‍♂️ kind of. I’m more a liquid dnb guy.
23/08/2021, 17:44 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: In my opinion, given all the covid, lockdown, cancellation, etc....Aidan did a good job.
23/08/2021, 17:45 - Callum: Acid but the group I was with were bad vibes and it took me three days to realise they were the reason I kept getting anxious 🥲
23/08/2021, 17:45 - Callum: Through a good soundsystem yes, otherwise no
23/08/2021, 17:46 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼. I am seriously considering trying out clubs and events for jungle (no @⁨Richard Hurst⁩ , you're not loosing a fan! )...just a minor "detour" for me...😁
23/08/2021, 17:47 - +1 (415) 351-9231: Ah so sorry. People are everything. Hopefully you found a crew with better vibes.
23/08/2021, 17:52 - +1 (415) 351-9231: @⁨Callum⁩ also what was up with the baby head in the tree? Was someone _trying_ to freak out the tripping ravers?
23/08/2021, 17:53 - Callum: <Media omitted>
23/08/2021, 17:53 - Callum: It was on a stick with silver tassels

23/08/2021, 17:54 - +1 (415) 351-9231: Oh man! 🤩
23/08/2021, 17:54 - Callum: There's always some people wearing scary trippy stuff though - there was a guy wearing a really fucked up owl mask with glowing eyes
23/08/2021, 17:54 - Callum: Didn't like that one 🥲
23/08/2021, 17:54 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: Reg anxiety: A non-zombie was introduced to me pre-dance and spoke me about anxiety, and we had a chat. A good, long chat. 
Later I got the most wonderful thanks message, and it topped everything from the festival. 🥰
Advice: Talk to someone just _before_ events.

Said with 0 proof because this has not happened. I'm not that guy.

In fairness, it should be mentioned that I have been friendly, *positive* and a good person. 😐

01/10/2021, 22:46 - Callum: You're 45?!?!
01/10/2021, 22:46 - Callum: I just assumed u were like 10 years younger than that!
01/10/2021, 22:47 - +1 (415) 351-9231: It’s a common assumption 😉
01/10/2021, 22:50 - +1 (415) 351-9231: Basically, I need a place until I can move in with Charlotte. While I lived with her previously, we decided it would be best if I wasn’t living with her now until her divorce is settled.

02/10/2021, 21:47 - Gav-Techno: Think he's in Berlin...
02/10/2021, 21:47 - Marius: It's good music for chilling but not for clubbing, u have been to a beach rave where they played minimal stuff and it was so good
02/10/2021, 21:47 - Marius: I have *
02/10/2021, 21:47 - Gav-Techno: Maybe I book vip ticket, and can lie down up there

04/10/2021, 23:39 - Callum: Signal, where groups go to die 🤪
05/10/2021, 00:11 - +1 (415) 351-9231: That’s only because people hate change.
05/10/2021, 00:12 - Callum: Or its because whatsapp contains more features that makes it easy to connect to people
05/10/2021, 00:14 - +1 (415) 351-9231: I didn’t expect you would defend a Facebook app so much. I mean, they’re pretty evil.
05/10/2021, 00:15 - Callum: Sure, but every group I'm in that has migrated to signal has died
05/10/2021, 00:15 - Callum: The morality of the company that makes the app doesn’t change that lol
05/10/2021, 00:16 - +1 (415) 351-9231: No, it doesn’t. But if the morality of parent companies doesn’t matter then we’re all fucked.

19/10/2021, 13:23 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: Why does WhatsApp have the option to delete old messages if messages are encrypted?
Is it coz the recipient(s) have limited phone storage capacity? 🤷🏻‍♂️🤔...i guess not.
19/10/2021, 13:26 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: *auto delete 7 day old messages
19/10/2021, 13:33 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: If its a feature that's barely used why would they add it? 
Anyone here uses that "disappearing" message option?
19/10/2021, 13:40 - Callum: I'm in some groups that use it a lot on signal
19/10/2021, 13:40 - Callum: It's so that if someone gains access to someone's phone they can't read old messages
19/10/2021, 13:42 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: Ok...that makes sense. 🙂 So the backups should be set on "daily" as the backups would have full texts.

21/10/2021, 04:48 - +1 (415) 351-9231: Covid storytime. I was in Mexico with my family Oct 2 - 9 for a postponed family holiday. It was a lot of fun. Then after I got back, my brother in law said my sister tested positive for covid. I was with her a lot and all day on Friday.

I started to have symptoms on Oct 11 and assumed the worst. I had a PCR test on Oct 12 and an antigen test on Oct 13, both which were negative. I started to feel better and by Saturday, Oct 16, I was feeling pretty good. So I attended an outside going away brunch I had planned for myself. Then on Monday, Oct 18, one week after I started to have symptoms, I suddenly felt very tired and noticed my sense of smell was muted. So I took a home antigen test, which was positive. This was devastating not only because I had been around friends when I was potentially contagious but also because I was planning to travel to UK next Monday (now delayed by a few days for other reasons). I contacted everyone who I had been in contact with and thankfully everyone who has tested is negative. Meanwhile I’ve taken a PCR test with Kaiser, which was positive.

So why did it not show up in the initial tests? I obviously can’t say with any certainty. However, I had a third vaccination a little over a month ago because I’m immunocompromised. I believe that because I’m recently vaccinated, it likely took a long time to build up in my system. Also, because I’m immunocompromised due to meds I take for Crohn’s, it was bound to infect me. After feeling pretty terrible yesterday, I’m feeling somewhat better today and hopefully even better tomorrow. The lesson for me, in this perhaps unique situation, is that tests may not always pick up covid if you’ve been recently vaccinated. Something to consider if/when you get a booster.

I’m hopeful that I’ll steadily return to health. Today was much better than yesterday so I’m hoping for more of that.

Thanks for reading and now back to your regular programming.
21/10/2021, 05:12 - Angel-techno: Get well soon Joshua 🤗
21/10/2021, 05:46 - +44 7968 472333: Of course you’ll steadily return to health mate. Keep well and keep us posted
21/10/2021, 06:09 - Vanessa: Get well soon @⁨+1 (415) 351-9231⁩ !! 🤗❤️
21/10/2021, 06:12 - Richard Hurst: Get well soon Josh. Glad your on the mend
21/10/2021, 07:22 - Christiana-techno: I am sorry to hear you caught the virus. I hope both you and your sister are feeling better and are recovering!
21/10/2021, 08:50 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: Thanks for sharing! Quite a few details in there! Get well soon. 
This virus is proving to be way more complicated than expected 😬
21/10/2021, 09:57 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: It's weird tho. I read somewhere that 70% of current hospital deaths in the UK are of patients who have been double vaccinated. 🤔🧐
21/10/2021, 10:00 - Christiana-techno: 😮
21/10/2021, 10:02 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: Yes, i know. 
But i don't have the original source. As you know, there are these evening tabloid...🤦🏻‍♂️🙄
So ...🤷🏻‍♂️
21/10/2021, 10:05 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: Every time i say that's the last I'm gonna read about covid, something new happens that requires more reading...🤦🏻‍♂️
The new surge in numbers is ...🧐
21/10/2021, 10:08 - Callum: Well yea
21/10/2021, 10:08 - Callum: And when 100% of people are double vaccinated, 100% of deaths will be of double vaccinated people
21/10/2021, 10:09 - Callum: The stats don't make sense that way round, if anything it's a sign of just how many people are vaccinated
21/10/2021, 10:16 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: Yes they don't make sense if the cause of death is the viral infect. I'm guessing in most cases the causes are other underlying issues. 
Tabloids! 🤦🏻‍♂️
21/10/2021, 10:17 - Callum: i mean, the cause is covid
21/10/2021, 10:17 - Callum: if that's what they're talking about
21/10/2021, 10:20 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: ...different vaccines have different efficacy levels, ...the immune system is complex,...there may be other variants lurking about...🤷🏻‍♂️
I stopped following this months ago.
21/10/2021, 13:38 - Gav-Techno: You'd need to clarify the 'somewhere' for that stat, as I'm doubting that's true..
21/10/2021, 13:40 - Gav-Techno: 🥴 get well soon Joshua, I'm sure you'll be okay. 🤗
21/10/2021, 13:45 - Callum: When 90+% of people aged 70+ are fully vaccinated why is the statistic unlikely?
21/10/2021, 13:51 - Gav-Techno: The Doubting is about not having facts about the source
21/10/2021, 13:54 - Gav-Techno: My data analysis job is about doubting everything and then proving assumptions right or wrong either way.

Percentages and averages can often be flawed metrics without further context.
21/10/2021, 14:00 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: Joe rogan interview with alex berenson. I stopped listening half way. I bit wishy-washy.
21/10/2021, 14:02 - Gav-Techno: All of the facts from all sources about covid are often so different to each other I never known what to believe
21/10/2021, 14:03 - Gav-Techno: In the UK's official figures you see on BBC its always concerned me they say *death for any reason within 28 days of positive test
21/10/2021, 14:04 - Gav-Techno: Like really does that include car accidents... it's just not clear enough
21/10/2021, 14:04 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: Yes...there's quite a bit of fake news or "nuanced news". People have social media platforms and push individual agends.
21/10/2021, 14:04 - Gav-Techno: Of course some numbers not reported at also not included in the statistics
21/10/2021, 14:05 - Gav-Techno: But then I think the statistics include people that shouldn't be included
21/10/2021, 14:05 - Gav-Techno: So does it average out to be correct...
21/10/2021, 14:08 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: I follow the reasoning that if 100% are vaccinated, due to efficacy of the vaccines (and other variables), we should expect covid-related deaths (or hospital admissions) to be approx equal to % lack of efficacy.
21/10/2021, 14:09 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: ...may be bit higher.
21/10/2021, 14:09 - Gav-Techno: Any suspicion I might have is because of the job that I do 🧐
Not a covid-19 denier 👁️
21/10/2021, 14:10 - Gav-Techno: Yeah that probably makes sense
21/10/2021, 14:10 - Gav-Techno: But we're at 80% aren't we
21/10/2021, 14:10 - Gav-Techno: Ish
21/10/2021, 14:12 - Gav-Techno: Antibodies are allegedly losing their effectiveness by now, that's why they are talking about 3rd booster jabs
21/10/2021, 14:13 - Gav-Techno: Will there be 4th 5th 10th
21/10/2021, 14:16 - Gav-Techno: first covid conversation I have had in months... dont actually want to carry on with it beyond hearing how Josh is doing 🤗
21/10/2021, 14:17 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: Not sure what % UK population already vaccinated. I stopped following this news hoping we leave the pandemic behind us....😭😭....😄
21/10/2021, 14:18 - Gav-Techno: Same
21/10/2021, 14:18 - Gav-Techno: I have really, been out so much😇
21/10/2021, 14:19 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: That's coz vaccine-induced immunity drops quicker than actual infection-induced immunity. So the best protected individuals are those who got infected, plus double shots. 😉
21/10/2021, 14:20 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: Have? Or haven't?
21/10/2021, 14:26 - Callum: it's a bit pointless doubting the statistic because _one day it will be true_
21/10/2021, 14:26 - Callum: as % of population vaccinated goes up, % of deaths where they're fully vaccinated goes up too
21/10/2021, 14:27 - Callum: being all like "omg this can't be true" now just validates the point of the anti-vaxxers in the future when it becomes true, when in fact it's just a dumb statistic that doesn't make any sense or prove the point vaccine opponents use it to prove
21/10/2021, 14:28 - Callum: right now, the % of people dying born after 2022 is zero. In twenty years, it will increase. In 200 years, it will be 100%. Does that mean there's something wrong with the year 2022? No, absolutely not. It's just a nonsensical statistic.
21/10/2021, 14:30 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: The stat that should be published, on a daily basis:
1) % deaths due to CV among non-vaccinated
2) % deaths due to CV among vaccinated.
21/10/2021, 14:32 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: If for every 100 vaccinated the death is, say 20, but among 100 non-vaccinated the death is 40, then that's easy to grasp.
21/10/2021, 14:32 - Callum: useful stat ^
21/10/2021, 14:33 - Callum: altho it makes it seem like you take the vaccine for individual reasons, when that's not true
21/10/2021, 14:38 - Gav-Techno: https://youtu.be/XEm8McxpGeg

Is something completely different....
 surviving being in third person for 50 hours 😊
21/10/2021, 14:38 - Gav-Techno: Have been out so much. Great summer.
21/10/2021, 14:39 - Gav-Techno: Summer over at Halloween, then straight into winter. 🥶😒
21/10/2021, 14:42 - Gav-Techno: Absolutely like I said % & averages can be very meaningless with context.
Currently management design the KPIs at my company and I'm supposed to just do them, but I'm trying to delicate explain how some of them don't really mean much..
21/10/2021, 14:42 - Gav-Techno: ***without context
21/10/2021, 14:43 - Gav-Techno: Due to people writing their CV? 😄
21/10/2021, 14:43 - Gav-Techno: That can certainly be a killer if you haven't done it for a while
21/10/2021, 14:44 - Gav-Techno: But yes Shin, that would be good stats
21/10/2021, 14:46 - Callum: the problem isn't that it's an average, it would be a dumb statistic if they used the true numbers too
21/10/2021, 14:48 - Gav-Techno: 100, 90, 10.  = important to use the right average, and given the volume/count is so low at just 3, you'll be right to point that out
21/10/2021, 14:49 - Gav-Techno: That's a slightly more exaggerated example of a real KPI
21/10/2021, 14:50 - Gav-Techno: The average is ok but I'm trying to argue that the volume needs reporting as well
21/10/2021, 14:50 - Gav-Techno: That's the context element
21/10/2021, 18:35 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: 🤦🏻‍♂️😆
21/10/2021, 22:12 - Gav-Techno: Tonight's bbc 10 oclock news just reported that 5 million adults haven't had any vaccine in UK and that they make up the majority of the people in hospital..
21/10/2021, 22:24 - Marius: Get well Josh, overdose on those vitamins and get your immune system to 100%, rest rest rest and you will be alright 🫂
21/10/2021, 22:29 - Marius: You guys with statistics 😂
21/10/2021, 22:30 - Marius: If you want to see some interesting statistics, check the mortality during Corona time compared with mortality before corona time 😁

22/10/2021, 22:32 - Callum: Hope you're feeling better soon! 🙏

25/10/2021, 20:54 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: What's the general feeling about travel during Xmas and risk of infections?
25/10/2021, 21:57 - Vanessa: I’m hesitantly booking my flights I think
25/10/2021, 21:58 - Vanessa: Like I do it but with a bit of a worry
26/10/2021, 05:26 - +1 (415) 351-9231: Air travel? About as risky as travel other times of the year. I think it comes down to how safe you are more than the circumstances of travel. Wear a mask at all times, wash your hands frequently, never touch your face and hope for the best 🙏🏻
26/10/2021, 06:44 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: 👍🏼😬...same feeling here...I've decided to stay put.
26/10/2021, 07:34 - Gav-Techno: Forced to in 2020. Decided London was a 6 month long summer holiday for 2021.
Getting a new passport for flights, somewhere, anywhere, in 2022

27/10/2021, 15:26 - +1 (415) 351-9231: Yes and yes.
27/10/2021, 19:15 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: Hey Josh 🤗...are you heading south to the healer in Peru, was it? For couple of months?
27/10/2021, 19:18 - +1 (415) 351-9231: Yes Peru for 40 days.
27/10/2021, 19:20 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: Well take care...are you going in a group?
27/10/2021, 19:29 - +1 (415) 351-9231: Thank you. I’m going alone.
28/10/2021, 07:50 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: What's the weather like, where you going? Is it high up in Peru? Is it a remote location or are you on a trekking trip?
28/10/2021, 15:26 - +1 (415) 351-9231: 20 - 35 C.  The rainy season just started so it will be wet. 500 meters. I don’t think it’s too remote. This is probably the closest landmark to where I’ll be.

13/12/2021, 12:45 - +1 (415) 351-9231: Gotta say, @⁨🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine⁩. Saw that coming. I haven’t followed very closely as I’ve had intermittent internet but I’m confused and also put off by your recent messages here.
13/12/2021, 13:06 - +44 7968 472333: This
13/12/2021, 13:15 - +1 (415) 351-9231: Actually while I was in Peru, I was thinking about this group (among many many other things) and was wondering if it’s time for the sun to set on Raver Lunch. It was created in a different time for a different purpose than it’s serving now, and I thought we all might benefit from having one less group. This isn’t to say that I love you all any less or don’t want to stay in touch. You’re all very lovely and sweet people, most of the time 😉

13/12/2021, 13:19 - +44 7968 472333: Funny you should say this @⁨+1 (415) 351-9231⁩. I was having similar thoughts about individual WhatsApp groups created per event. Are they necessary? 🤷🏻‍♂️
