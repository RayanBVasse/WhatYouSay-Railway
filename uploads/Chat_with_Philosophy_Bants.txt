17/09/2022, 07:30 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: Happy birthday @⁨Alba⁩ ..late by 1 day..😎🥳
20/09/2022, 08:21 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: Is there a philosophical reason why we need a social? 😉
20/09/2022, 13:45 - +44 7931 083103: Change in the weather?

23/09/2022, 23:17 - Ali: Hope you are well too?
24/09/2022, 09:50 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: Why is this the last?... last online or last in general?

01/10/2022, 18:44 - Alba: We had lunch from people from work. 
When shall we do a social?
07/10/2022, 18:29 - +44 7931 083103: The other group has gone nuts. More than 1,500 messages in just a handful of days
07/10/2022, 18:33 - Imran-philo: mute & archive
07/10/2022, 18:33 - +44 7931 083103: It's more an observation
07/10/2022, 19:12 - Ali: It’s because I’ve moved the bants there
07/10/2022, 19:12 - Ali: 🙈

18/10/2022, 13:41 - +44 7931 083103: No idea, too many messages to follow!
18/10/2022, 14:20 - Jake: I literally shudder at the amount of time I wasted in those philosophy whatsapp debates.

18/10/2022, 15:16 - Will-hazzer777: Bants bants!
18/10/2022, 15:16 - Ali: There’s very rarely many attacks here. Mostly just love and funnies
18/10/2022, 15:18 - +1 (609) 759-1174: Then I'll start with the funnies! https://globalnews.ca/news/9193160/fake-russian-astronaut-romance-scam-japan/

18/10/2022, 15:19 - +1 (609) 759-1174: Fake ‘Russian astronaut’ scammed woman out of over $41K to ‘return to Earth’
18/10/2022, 15:20 - Gareth: Hahaha
18/10/2022, 15:20 - Gareth: ‘Ere we go!
18/10/2022, 15:27 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: I'm seriously questioning whether people become wiser ad they grow old! 🤷🏻‍♂️😌
18/10/2022, 15:28 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: *as
18/10/2022, 15:28 - +1 (609) 759-1174: Maybe just desperate for love? 🥰
18/10/2022, 15:29 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: Oh...is that how her conned her? Promise of love? 
(I only read the headline).
18/10/2022, 15:30 - +1 (609) 759-1174: Yes - he said he loves her and wanted to marry her, but didn't have money to pay for 'parking charges' for his spacecraft to land in Japan
18/10/2022, 15:32 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: 😅🙈....41K... daym!! 
I'm assuming the search process for just the right victim should be detailed... how many does he have to screen thru to finally cash in? 😒
18/10/2022, 15:33 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: Which is more jaw dropping ....her gullibility and need for love...
Or his skills?
18/10/2022, 15:36 - +1 (609) 759-1174: For these scammers, it's just a numbers game - they prey on the vulnerable, lonely, depressed, and they just move on, like locusts - they reach out to enough people, they're bound to find a sucker, unfortunately!
18/10/2022, 15:47 - Jake: this stuff is often automatised with bots first to find the guillable people, and the passed onto the human fraudsters.
18/10/2022, 15:53 - +1 (609) 759-1174: Talk about 'misuse' of science and technology
18/10/2022, 16:28 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: I came across a few bots...in financial services like crypto...for the uninitiated these are actually quite sofisticated ...
The bots have a algorithm to alert the owners when to actually step in, and take over...past athreshold of responses (numbers, frequency, content,  picture attachments etc). 😉
Just as FYI.
18/10/2022, 16:30 - +1 (609) 759-1174: Now I think of it, I have seen these random 'Hey! How are you doing?' from complete strangers on Meetup and even WhatsApp!
18/10/2022, 16:35 - Jake: Hey! How are you doing?
18/10/2022, 16:37 - +1 (609) 759-1174: You're not Jake the astronaut, by any chance, are you?!??
18/10/2022, 16:38 - Jake: I can only confirm after you have given me your debit card details.
18/10/2022, 16:47 - Gareth: 1234 4322 1234 9864
09 21
Number on the back is 007
18/10/2022, 16:47 - Gareth: What do I get?
18/10/2022, 16:48 - +1 (609) 759-1174: The name on the card is 'Bond', of course. James Bond.
18/10/2022, 16:48 - Gareth: Was just about to say that!
18/10/2022, 16:48 - Gareth: I keep it next to the license
18/10/2022, 16:49 - +1 (609) 759-1174: To kill? hehe
18/10/2022, 16:49 - Gareth: Of course
18/10/2022, 16:50 - +1 (609) 759-1174: Well, I have one that says 'Driving', but it's essentially the same!
18/10/2022, 16:50 - +1 (609) 759-1174: I even paid insurance for it! :)
18/10/2022, 22:46 - +1 (609) 759-1174: But on a serious note, is the 'License to Kill' really a license? In most Bond movies, he can kill anybody, but he still has to flee from the local police, and if he's caught, he's 'persona non grata'... So the 'license' only applies when he's caught by British police, then MI6 can step in an use 'National Security' to get him off the hook... But then, one of the primary restrictions on his 'License to Kill' is that he cannot kill British citizens, nor can he use the 'license' within British territory!
18/10/2022, 22:47 - +1 (609) 759-1174: So I ask again, what is 'The License to Kill' good for, that any comparable two-bit gangster / assassin cannot make a plastic card for himself claiming 'License to Kill'?'
18/10/2022, 22:48 - +1 (609) 759-1174: And to top it all, whenever Bond actually uses the 'License to Kill' in a messy way, by either assassinating a VIP foreign dignitary or causes an 'international incident', he gets a 'dressing down' from M which I would argue is worse than a police prosecution, because at least in the court you can pay for high-powered lawyers to get you off! 😂
18/10/2022, 22:48 - +1 (609) 759-1174: #justrantin'
19/10/2022, 08:39 - Jake: you are broadly right. If MI6 granted a licence to kill, it would not be recognised by foreign countries (especially hostile ones). James Bond would also not benefit from diplomatic immunity (which broadly removes criminal liability for most crimes) unless he is a declared diplomat - which he never is in the movies.
19/10/2022, 08:42 - Jake: I think the british courts could claim jurisdiction for a murder carried out anywhere in the world, providing it was done by a british subject. However, in practice, it would more usually be tried in the country where the crime took place.  

So, I think the licence to kill is not really about criminal offences, and more about avoiding an HR issue at Mi6 - ie. if he kills someone under his licence, then he would not get the sack.
19/10/2022, 08:49 - Gareth: Killing is generally considered wrong eh?
19/10/2022, 08:51 - Jake: depends what we mean by "generally".  If it is done by a soldier through a legal war, it is generally considered right.
19/10/2022, 08:52 - Jake: i think "generally" probably means "the majority of occasions".
19/10/2022, 08:52 - Jake: by that definition, I think most killing is carried out by doctors through medical negligence that never gets reported.
19/10/2022, 08:56 - Gareth: Isn’t it considered wrong but correct or necessary?
19/10/2022, 09:05 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: Note that Bond targets foreigners in remote countries, and flees the territory...and therefore cannot be prosecuted the justice system of that country. 🤷🏻‍♂️...
19/10/2022, 10:39 - Jake: I am not sure there is a difference between what is wrong, on the one hand, and what is correct or necessary, on the other hand. But this depends on what we mean when we say something is wrong.
19/10/2022, 10:41 - Gareth: What makes something regrettable?
19/10/2022, 10:41 - Gareth: Perhaps it’s where two goods must be weighed against one another
19/10/2022, 10:41 - Jake: what is regrettable is not necessarily what is wrong or what is correct/necessary
19/10/2022, 10:42 - Jake: it is regrettable that I forgot to buy milk last night for my cereal, because this morning I didn't have time to go the shops.
19/10/2022, 10:43 - Jake: regrettable is probably a superset of what is immoral - ie. it includes everything unethical plus other things that we regret for other reasons.
19/10/2022, 11:15 - +1 (609) 759-1174: Regret is also a subjective post event feeling - you rarely do a task knowing you're going to regret it
19/10/2022, 11:30 - Gareth: Well
19/10/2022, 11:30 - Gareth: Isn’t it predictable when you need to choose between two or more good things?
19/10/2022, 11:31 - Gareth: Also - regret is a consequence of character rather than circumstance in many cases. Some people are regretful
19/10/2022, 11:35 - +1 (609) 759-1174: But this is also a 'consequence of character', I would argue - some people regret everything they do, whereas others seem so cocksure that they always chose right
19/10/2022, 13:02 - Gareth: Yes, where others are perhaps affected by the circumstance,
19/10/2022, 13:02 - Gareth: ?
25/10/2022, 17:31 - Annie: <Media omitted>
25/10/2022, 17:38 - Ali: Love to you @⁨Annie⁩ xxx
25/10/2022, 17:38 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: 😅🤣...but i have to admit...no one's better than Jon Stewart
25/10/2022, 17:48 - +44 7507 577140: 👍👍
25/10/2022, 20:48 - Annie: 🤗🤗🤗
25/10/2022, 20:49 - Annie: Yeah, love him too.
26/10/2022, 15:21 - +44 7931 083103: What do you think of his accent? Seems like it's weakened a bit to me
26/10/2022, 15:43 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: You mean he's loosing his South African, and the New Yorkian is rubbing off?
26/10/2022, 15:51 - +1 (609) 759-1174: But he can still do accents, I love not only his South African, but even his Indian accent! lol
26/10/2022, 15:51 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: It's interesting that Jon Stewart never did accents!
26/10/2022, 15:52 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: Yeah...does many accents...😅...i find it funny when he does African accents!!
26/10/2022, 16:08 - +44 7931 083103: Sounded like it!
26/10/2022, 16:16 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: You guys watch Colbert?
26/10/2022, 16:18 - Annie: Probably.   His accent is acclimatising to NY too.  
I was part of the audience for a recording of TDS, about five years ago and I could detect his SA accent dimming.  Quite expected  when you do accents.
26/10/2022, 16:19 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: Colbert...🤦🏻‍♂️😅...can you tell if he's genuinely religious or not!! He is so funny  yet clever with his audience 😉
26/10/2022, 16:20 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: Speaking of South Africa...have you guys watch BBC documentary about Elon Musk?
26/10/2022, 16:21 - +1 (609) 759-1174: I think he's openly religious (Catholic) and he makes no bones about it
26/10/2022, 16:21 - +1 (609) 759-1174: But he's pro-abortion, in that he breaks with his church
26/10/2022, 16:22 - +1 (609) 759-1174: Elon Musk is just a smarter version of Trump - is he worth two hours of our time? 😅
26/10/2022, 16:24 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: Openly catholic...for his South Carolina base. But so many episodes...specially interviews with Hayden Planetarium boss...whatever his name is...and other physicists ..😑🙄...he walks a very thin line. 😁
26/10/2022, 16:27 - +1 (609) 759-1174: Neil deGrasse Tyson
26/10/2022, 16:27 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: I didn't know much about his personal life, that he has a brother...that tesla narrowly missed ever becoming a car...
Love his management style. 💙
26/10/2022, 16:28 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: Elon left home with 17 USD in pocket
T%&*#@! Is no comparison.
26/10/2022, 16:30 - +1 (609) 759-1174: C'mon, his dad was a Billionaire - if he left with $17 in his pocket, it was mostly an act of drunken rebellion
26/10/2022, 16:32 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: If his dad offered him money, that would be a different case. 
But he is smart, hard working, and is changing the world....i ways no other person (with money) can. 
Most other rich ppl chase money....coz that's all they are good at.
26/10/2022, 17:16 - +358 44 9508331: If you're interested in Musk, or the rich and powerful more generally, then 40 pages of Musk's private messages with various bigwigs got released/leaked (not sure which) as part of the twitter sale court case: https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/23112929/elon-musk-text-exhibits-twitter-v-musk.pdf

I found it a fascinating window into how those with humonguous power discuss, negotiate, and make decisions.
26/10/2022, 17:24 - +358 44 9508331: Here's one my favourite bits, between Elon and Larry Ellison, the cofounder and ex-CEO of Oracle and by some estimate 11th richest person on the planet:
Elon: Any interest in participating in the Twitter deal?
Larry Ellison: Yes... of course :thumb-up:
Elon: Cool
Elon: Roughly what dollar size? Not holding you to anything, but the deal is oversubscribed, so I have to reduce or kick out some participants.
Larry Ellison: A billion...or whatever you recommend
Elon: Whatever works for you. I'd recommend maybe $2B or more. This has very high potential and I'd rather have you than anyone else.
Larry Ellison: I agree that it has huge potential... and it would be lots of fun
Elon: Absolutely :)
26/10/2022, 17:24 - +358 44 9508331: Now _that_, is power
26/10/2022, 17:25 - +358 44 9508331: It's all so surreally casual
26/10/2022, 17:26 - +1 (609) 759-1174: Like ordering takeout
26/10/2022, 17:41 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: Ellison, Bezos, etc...100s of others...stopped taking massive risks...(to improve or change or innovate).... Thats coz they know their business sectors quite well...but not much beyond that.

This guy, Elon...after paypal, builds eCars, and then reusable rockets... and vacuum shuttles. .. .not to mention neuralinks.

All of these are massive risks, requiring a very broad grasp of technology...a sharp mind! Not just luck or work.

He does not own estates, yachts and private jets.
26/10/2022, 17:45 - +1 (609) 759-1174: Really? https://www.protocol.com/elon-musk-flight-tracker
26/10/2022, 17:48 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: If someone tracks my car, whereabouts, and puts the data up on twitter...🤷🏻‍♂️...i might wanna stop it.

26/10/2022, 17:49 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: 😅😅 ..fine..
26/10/2022, 17:49 - +1 (609) 759-1174: It was a comment on 'he does not own estates, yachts, and private jets'
26/10/2022, 17:49 - +1 (609) 759-1174: Not a critique on him trying to stop it
26/10/2022, 17:49 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: So he has glitter. .
..but i like his innovations...
26/10/2022, 17:50 - +1 (609) 759-1174: Say that! I like Larry Page's innovations
26/10/2022, 17:50 - +1 (609) 759-1174: And someone else might like Zucky's
26/10/2022, 17:50 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: Fair point...😄
26/10/2022, 17:51 - +1 (609) 759-1174: I was just saying you were making him out to be 'different' than all the other rich folk, whereas I just proved he's not just one of them, he's King of them!
26/10/2022, 17:52 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: I'm not stopping anyone from liking others. 
My point is ...there isn't anyone on the planet who's got the balls, brains, guts and money that Elon has....👍🏼
26/10/2022, 17:52 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: I think he is the richest person atm.
26/10/2022, 17:57 - +1 (609) 759-1174: That's a subjective statement - Jeff Bezos has also created a space tourism business after Amazon, Larry Ellison set up a Medical Foundation that has so far funded 3 scientists who later on won Nobel Laureates
26/10/2022, 17:58 - +1 (609) 759-1174: I just think there's too much hype over Elon - mostly because he's like Steve Jobs when it comes to self-marketing
26/10/2022, 17:59 - +1 (609) 759-1174: Plus his ego trips are downright funny, too
26/10/2022, 17:59 - +1 (609) 759-1174: Like with the Thai Prime Minister over the rescue of the children, and now with Ukraine
26/10/2022, 18:00 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: Yeah...sure 🙂🙃...defo subjective!...i like bold risk takers...high stakes,... he's cool! 😎😎
27/10/2022, 00:07 - +358 44 9508331: I think most of the hype is well deserved just because of his name. Who the hell is called _Elon Musk_? That's the kind of power name that makes you essentially destined for greatness.
27/10/2022, 01:30 - +1 (609) 759-1174: What about the name Musk gave his son - X Æ A-12? Do you think X Æ A-12 Musk is a 'power name that makes him essentially destined for greatness'?
27/10/2022, 08:30 - +358 44 9508331: I think it makes him destined for embarrassment, ridicule, and quite possibly school bullying.
27/10/2022, 13:51 - +1 (609) 759-1174: I wonder what a 'Billionaire bully' or a 'Billionaire Bullier' - someone who bullies the world's richest kid (Richie Rich?) looks like... 🤣
27/10/2022, 15:52 - Will-hazzer777: Rishi Rich 😅
27/10/2022, 21:22 - +1 (609) 759-1174: You forgot the Rt. Hon. part... 😛

Busy but trying to wind down for the year. London is a strange place over the festive period though, most people go home

30/11/2022, 09:05 - +1 (609) 759-1174: Beer is available, just not in the stadiums... Fans are 'welcome' to drink at pubs or restaurants and watch the live match on TV, but why fly 3000 miles to Doha to do that when you can do that in SoHo? 😉
30/11/2022, 09:36 - +1 (609) 759-1174: I mean, they have a right to be absolutely terrified of legions of drunk English fans, but is our notorious reputation warranted or overblown? 😜😝🤣🍻

23/12/2022, 17:49 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: Situational humor: Hard to describe, impossible to replicate. 😊

Here is one i think was funny ...was talking to a middle -aged woman on a hike in the summer. We were talking about humor. 
Then she said "A co-worker called in sick due to wrist injury the other day". I said, okay, let's do a top 5 "Funny reasons for calling in sick for a wrist injury" joke.
I started giving her 5 funny reasons, ... like "Rich Saudi uncle gifted me a Rolex", "Was playing an aggressive Chess game over the weekend", etc etc  but realized she had strangely stopped talking... 🤔😉...

So i said "And the top reason to call in sick due to wrist injury...", i looked at her and said... 
"No it's not what you are thinking"...
And we both loooool...😅😅
23/12/2022, 17:52 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: Situational humor is quite spontaneous and specific to the real life situation.... because it is _real life_, _real people_, it has real insight and good value!! 
The reactions are priceless. 😉
23/12/2022, 18:58 - Alba: Nice, you’re funny , we missed you last week 😊
24/12/2022, 05:09 - +44 7507 577140: 'Realised she had strangely stopped talking'
24/12/2022, 08:54 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: Yeah.. coz she was quite chatty up until then. And i had suggested _5 reasons_, not 1 or 2. ...and she didn't come up with a single...so yes, it was strange that she had stopped contributing to the convo. 🤷🏻‍♂️😊
24/12/2022, 08:55 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: There had to be a reason....😁
24/12/2022, 08:56 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: Enjoy Xmas &NY, you'll...☺️👋🏼
24/12/2022, 09:58 - Alba: Do you have great plans for Christmas ?
24/12/2022, 10:04 - Alba: My friend Dave told me you can’t fast at Christmas and I ended  🆙 with a miserable salad 🥗.
24/12/2022, 13:35 - +44 7474 783050: Merry Xmas everyone, hohoho! 🎶
25/12/2022, 11:12 - Alba: You deserve it! I saw Aviad yesterday, we’re neighbours!😄
25/12/2022, 11:19 - +44 7931 083103: Meet Christmas everyone! Hope you all have a great day and a nice break 😁

27/12/2022, 10:25 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: How is a dadbod physically attactive to a woman? 🤷🏻‍♂️. .. 
I never see magazine covers of sexy dadbodz...no tit-tocs, no only-fans, etc ☺️
27/12/2022, 10:30 - Ali: I don’t think that’s common @⁨🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine⁩ but some people don’t put attractiveness of bodies high on their list. You know ? It’s more about personality or some other traits.
27/12/2022, 10:31 - Ali: I dont find a muscly men that attractive for example. I wouldn’t mind a dad bod as much.. but a willing to make an effort and keep physically fit is important, as it shows a willingness of self improvement.
27/12/2022, 10:31 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: Ok...what's your rough estimate... 10% of women find dadbodz attractive?
27/12/2022, 10:31 - Ali: Yer I reckon so
27/12/2022, 10:32 - Ali: Or maybe 6%
27/12/2022, 10:32 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: Also...it _has_ to be physical, to some extent, no? How would anyone know the personality? ☺️😊
27/12/2022, 10:34 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: So i met 2, recently. 
Both fit, pretty, lean, and quite charming...but both so attracted to dadbodz.... it was like total infatuation, no-question-asked... 😄...
27/12/2022, 10:35 - Ali: I don’t think it is for some people. Sometimes in life you just get chatting to people, you have a connection or something in common and then a spark.
27/12/2022, 10:37 - Ali: The other month I saw a poor man who had burns all over his face, he was with a beautiful woman. They were very much in love. You could tell she cared for him and loved him.
27/12/2022, 10:38 - Ali: It may be all about looks for men… but for women I think it’s different.
27/12/2022, 10:39 - Ali: There’s been a few very attractive looking guys I’ve come across but as soon as they open their mouths i have found them to be repulsive.
27/12/2022, 10:41 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: Humm...☺️.. complex... this thing called attraction.
27/12/2022, 10:46 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: Dadbodz dating app!! 😉
27/12/2022, 13:50 - Alba: I totally agree with Ali. 
Really if you have the spark I  don’t mind much dadbod. 🤣
Sometimes we’re obsessed with our bodies , but souls, intelligence, chemistry, hobbies in common  and humour are more important . 
But obviously the attraction and the healthy habits could be better with people who are fit . 
Dave e.g. watches football has a bit of belly now etc and I don’t mind (I’m not as fit as before ) but you realise with some people who have other intelligence or intellectual 🧐 and cultivated brain you’re more compatible . Or just a bit more passionate people or not that laidback.. 
Also the sex is better when you’re both fit. 😅😂
But it doesn’t matter much. 
If you like or are fond into someone you have to accept with his flaws and strengths . 
We’re only humans … 
Lonely ones 😂😏🤓
We should pursue our big ❤️ or personality  , be respected not being sexual objects .
27/12/2022, 13:54 - Alba: So your girls told you you’re too fit ? 😂😂🧐
27/12/2022, 14:40 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: Fair point...😌
Aren't dadboz a bit restricted in bedroom performance? 😜😉

Anyways...we all have "types".. 😇
27/12/2022, 14:42 - Will-hazzer777: The magazine covers of muscular men are for men... E.g. on men's health magazine. It's what men think they should look like and what women therefore must like. Women however don't necessary like a muscular man or someone with a hairless chest.
27/12/2022, 14:42 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: Well, what got me think was when one of these ladies told me that she used to ask a friend to stuff a pillow under her shirt, and do a role-play of a teacher-student scene. . ..
So... it really got me thinking... specially as they were/are lean, and quite charming.... 🤷🏻‍♂️
It's the exception that's always interesting.  😉
27/12/2022, 14:44 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: Exactly...a dating app for "non-cover mag" types... 😊👍🏼... some1 should give it a try.
27/12/2022, 14:45 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: Dating app for women who like going out with men shorter then themselves 🤷🏻‍♂️
27/12/2022, 14:49 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: Dating "Not-your-average" type app.
Shorter?
Dadbod?
Bald?
Math genius, but shy?🤷🏻‍♂️
27/12/2022, 14:48 - Alba: Shin, you’re wondeful , don’t overthink ;)
27/12/2022, 14:48 - Alba: Wonderful ** Hahaha

30/12/2022, 22:10 - Alba: Do you have plans for NYE?
30/12/2022, 22:39 - Alba: Who wants to join me in NYE 😴?❄️ 
https://youtu.be/8UA1lBqXOeo
There is a big party 🎉 there .
30/12/2022, 22:53 - Alba: Joel doesn’t allow me to be in the book chat 🙃 even if I can’t attend , pff
30/12/2022, 22:54 - Alba: I really like his groups but I feel excluded and sometimes he kicked me out only when I was talking about Borges or Shakespeare 🤣I know I was a pain in the ass with the crush but 😂🙄🙄🙄It was a long time ago
30/12/2022, 23:03 - Alba: I felt weird sometimes in London, I have wonderful friends but in Spain everyone is open , friendly there for you and here the work life makes us selfish in a way, what do you think? At the end everyone is free but e.g. I send greeting to a lover we had really good times together at Christmas and he told me : Alba wrong number . Don’t say Alba . 
Some people are just not realible. 
Obviously there are always wonderful people everywhere but there is not true love in the heart of the city 🌆 as I always find in Spain. 
Perhaps there is too much and I feel overwhelmed in my country , people super touchy and full on and I became 🥶 a bit Brit but I still have the cultural shock.
30/12/2022, 23:04 - Alba: They are**
30/12/2022, 23:17 - Alba: Reliable * sorry too rush too hectic

30/12/2022, 23:49 - Alba: If you don’t have plans guys I invite you to a soirée in Hampstead.
30/12/2022, 23:49 - Alba: You are welcome to come to mine .

01/01/2023, 19:30 - Oladoke: 😅
01/01/2023, 19:32 - Oladoke: Has anyone seen this show
01/01/2023, 19:32 - Oladoke: https://youtu.be/Noy4UeGGr0k
01/01/2023, 19:33 - Oladoke: Such a well made series
01/01/2023, 19:33 - Ali: Is it good? I was looking at it
01/01/2023, 19:37 - Oladoke: Amazing
01/01/2023, 19:38 - Oladoke: First episode requires some patience
01/01/2023, 19:38 - Oladoke: But it builds up quickly after that
01/01/2023, 19:39 - Ali: Great! I’ll watch it this week. Thanks for sharing x
01/01/2023, 20:16 - Oladoke: Make sure you start from season 1
01/01/2023, 20:16 - Oladoke: Netflix shows season two first in the listing
01/01/2023, 20:42 - Gareth: Anyone else watching Tokyo Stories?
01/01/2023, 23:44 - Alba: For me means sex night if you invite someone over  ,how do you feel it after having sex with someone and dancing naked the guy in question , Dave left and he told me I’ve insomnia I don’t want to sleep with you?
01/01/2023, 23:45 - Alba: And also how do you feel if he tells you he goes to happy ending massage in Old  high street ?! 🤣💫🤪🤪🤪🤪
01/01/2023, 23:45 - Alba: I mean it could be normal but for me it’s like paying a prostitute or almost
01/01/2023, 23:45 - Alba: 🥲🥲
01/01/2023, 23:45 - Alba: Too much expectations , sorry for changing the subject
01/01/2023, 23:51 - Ali: It wasn’t at Michael’s place was it?
01/01/2023, 23:51 - Alba: Lol, not
01/01/2023, 23:51 - Alba: Dave the guy I used to see last year he lives in Old street
01/01/2023, 23:52 - Alba: But you can’t trust in anyone
01/01/2023, 23:52 - Alba: I’ve big trust issues
01/01/2023, 23:52 - Alba: I feel like shit to be honesty
01/01/2023, 23:52 - Alba: Honest*
01/01/2023, 23:52 - Alba: Sex is not Mc Donald’s
01/01/2023, 23:53 - Alba: I know he wanted to sleep 😴 but he supposed to sleep over have breakfast and go to Hampstead tomorrow
01/01/2023, 23:57 - Ali: People change their minds and that’s ok. Maybe he felt funny and just wanted a quiet night. These things happen. Don’t worry about it.
01/01/2023, 23:58 - Alba: Thanks Ali. 😊🧘‍♀️Sorry too personal but As the magic weird pill failed not the blue , he never had to take one , he didn’t cum and as a result he didn’t want to sleep with me 😂😴😴 Don’t experiment with weird pills 🙃
02/01/2023, 00:00 - Alba: But when you’re into someone you want to spend the night with that person or not necessary?
02/01/2023, 00:04 - Ali: Some people like to take it slow. They don’t want to rush getting to know someone so maybe that’s what he was thinking. You could always ask him ☺️
02/01/2023, 00:08 - Alba: We know each other for a year
02/01/2023, 00:09 - Alba: Perhaps he’s seeing someone else and also with that weird pill the sex wasn’t great as always as before
02/01/2023, 00:09 - Alba: 😂😅 Probably he’s not into me and that way he makes it clear
02/01/2023, 00:09 - Alba: Just friends, we had a wonderful eve
02/01/2023, 00:09 - Alba: Messing around with Hinge
02/01/2023, 00:09 - Alba: Freedom
02/01/2023, 00:10 - Alba: I’m happy to explore better options he’s not for me etc
02/01/2023, 00:12 - +44 7507 577140: McDonald's lawyers won't  like that
02/01/2023, 00:14 - +44 7507 577140: So before I rat you out to them I just want to state for the record that I think sex IS mcdonald's
02/01/2023, 00:21 - Alba: How many people go to happy ending Thai? It would be amazing if the black or big handsome white boys would do a business for girls😂😂
02/01/2023, 00:21 - Alba: I mean it’s London I should be open minded
02/01/2023, 00:22 - Alba: But come on it’s similar to prostitutes , they gave you the massage naked rubbing you and after finishing you
02/01/2023, 07:03 - Gareth: Group living up to its bants status I see
02/01/2023, 07:04 - Gareth: This is why the term ‘sex worker’ has become more popular. People selling  sexual content, whether media or personal services are participants in the same industry.
02/01/2023, 07:31 - Oladoke: That’s not true, there are trust worthy people out there and that’s not me guessing.

If you use the “bottom to top” approach (legs first, what’s in their head later) to know people, you will have to kiss a few frogs before finding that Prince. Not saying that approach doesn’t work, just a little more work. Besides, someone has to assist mother Christmas handout free goods when she’s busy 😂
02/01/2023, 07:47 - Gareth: I realised I’m a frog a few years ago and adjusted my expectations a little
02/01/2023, 08:45 - Alba: Haha, I see but I know this guy for a year, we didn’t have sex until a few dates (perhaps 4 months ) going out in and off 🥲😂😂😂 because we didn’t see each other for a while(3 months or so) Hermit , COViD , Hinge ..
02/01/2023, 08:46 - Alba: Haha thanks for the tips. I’m just trying to respect myself 💪🏻
02/01/2023, 08:46 - Alba: Have a lovely sunny ☀️ day, bank holiday!
02/01/2023, 08:48 - Alba: And also don’t you think sometimes people dislike deep conversations and they’re too simple? 
I like being deep . For me it’s a way to connect with someone , having an intellectual conversation
02/01/2023, 08:49 - Alba: I’m not here just to watch TV or football as many people love
02/01/2023, 09:58 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: Escorts...
02/01/2023, 10:01 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: Why do we like another person anyways? 1. Either sex or 2. emotional attachment or 3. both. 

If you know what the other person wants from you & and will offer (1, 2 or 3), then you'll never be surprised, dissatisfied, disappointed, 💔, ...you'll always know where you stand w.r.t. others. 😊😇....IMHO
02/01/2023, 11:07 - Alba: Good answer , just having a good time and not overthinking ;)
02/01/2023, 11:34 - Gareth: Where does this leave cooperation?
02/01/2023, 11:58 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: Broadly under Nr 2.
Team work rely on trust, and trust is a type of emotional connection
02/01/2023, 12:19 - Alba: That’s true, but also understanding the needs of each other, space , freedom, crazy insomnia, be there for you but not overwhelming . I guess fwb work in this London 🌍 sometimes better than romantic relationships or having expectations which make you suffer😴Just live the moment and once you realise you’re right for each other that person will come
02/01/2023, 12:28 - Oladoke: 😂
02/01/2023, 12:30 - Gareth: Then your definitions are very wide
02/01/2023, 12:30 - Gareth: Isn’t this true for everyone?
02/01/2023, 12:32 - Oladoke: I can see that point, but I’ve always thought - one woman’s frog is another woman’s Prince, even wife abusers need love too… you did not hear that from me 😂
02/01/2023, 12:33 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: Yes,...friendships, family, coworkers,  WhatApps group chats, etc....all go under reason Nr 2....why we "like someone". It's broad, for simplicity reasons. 

When the transaction is clear 1 for 1, or 3 for 3...its all good.
But if i offer 1 for 3, but in return get 1, then 💔
02/01/2023, 12:33 - Gareth: Again, comes down to how wide your definitions of abuse are
02/01/2023, 12:33 - Gareth: Definitions lose their value when they include too much
02/01/2023, 12:34 - Gareth: At least I think they do
02/01/2023, 12:34 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: Fair point, but for functionality and application.
02/01/2023, 12:35 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: Transactions if unequal, lead to 💔
02/01/2023, 14:45 - Gareth: What are we categorising as a transaction here,
02/01/2023, 15:08 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: Coworkers working together.
Friends connecting & trusting
Love & sex
Family helping with difficulties 
Etc.

From different counties?...she found that out on her 1st date?...not before?
Nothing in common?...does that take a _date_ to find out?
😅😅
She'll so lame!!
02/01/2023, 20:13 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: I've a friend who goes on a lot of dates. Says it's quite expensive... like 1000/month.
02/01/2023, 20:15 - Oladoke: 😅
02/01/2023, 20:16 - Oladoke: Yep, I’ve heard the same thing. Who said love was free? 😅

Why save for a house when you can waste it on unfruitful events
02/01/2023, 20:18 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: My friend said he meets some girls who are on dating site but looking for a monogamous fwb, who shows them a good time, buys them stuff, spends on them...instead of a romantic connection. 
Apparently these girls are quite successful in finding such guys on dating apps.
02/01/2023, 20:26 - Oladoke: Yes, there is a famous London one who blogs about it. One of her dates recognised her vaguely and after saying she had to go to the ladies, walked out of the restaurant
03/01/2023, 10:26 - Oladoke: have any of the writers/bloggers here tried any of the AI writing tools online? I've heard really good things

06/01/2023, 18:44 - Annie: https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/how-to-be-happy-alone
06/01/2023, 18:46 - Annie: Happy You time:  2023!  🥳
06/01/2023, 19:14 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: "Meaningful connections"...
That's what the article says, matters.
06/01/2023, 19:15 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: It is actually quite rare a person is totally cut off, nowadays.
Social media, coworkers, hobbies...🤷🏻‍♂️☺️...
06/01/2023, 19:23 - Annie: Yeah.  The most challenging one is with yourself,  perhaps.
06/01/2023, 19:30 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: Fair point, but lemme ask a dumb 😄 question.
When _does_ one feel *lonely*?
When _is_ one *alone*? 

Say, i go to a new place, for a period of time, and it happens to  be my b'day...my meaningful connections are not around, i may feel *lonely*, having a dinner by my own. 
Acceptable example of being lonely? 

Watching tele, then text, then podcast, then gym, dinner. To bed. All *alone*. Not feeling lonely.
06/01/2023, 19:31 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: There are fleeting, rare occasions when we are lonely or alone 🤷🏻‍♂️
06/01/2023, 19:32 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: We can _choose_ a hermetic life...to be alone.
06/01/2023, 19:32 - Annie: We are alone.  
However, we feel lonely when we measure/compare our _aloneness_
06/01/2023, 19:33 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: Makes sense.
06/01/2023, 19:35 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: So the best way to be blissfully alone, is not to measure (or compare) our aloneness. 
Be with our own self.
06/01/2023, 19:36 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: But we are social creatures...🙈
We will socialise and compare.
06/01/2023, 19:37 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: Stay busy == Never feel lonely! ☺️
06/01/2023, 19:43 - Annie: Ideally, yes.
06/01/2023, 19:44 - Annie: That's fine.  But the take away from the article is that it is okay not to measure, mostly.
06/01/2023, 19:45 - Annie: Or do nothing, too.
06/01/2023, 19:47 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: What does "doing nothing" mean?
06/01/2023, 19:48 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: It's hard to be doing nothing, no? We take a walk, we cook, we read, we watch news, ...we work... we are always doing smt.
06/01/2023, 19:49 - Annie: Not doing something.  😄
06/01/2023, 19:50 - Annie: In context, probably not socialising or connecting meaningfully.
06/01/2023, 19:51 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: Not connecting meaningfully..that's a hard one. That would surely feel lonely.
06/01/2023, 19:52 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: We could have many people around us, yet feel lonely. 😑
06/01/2023, 19:55 - Annie: We could, if we do not have meaningful connections with them.  
If we did not, then we would not feel lonely.   
Hahaha!  Am I lonely cause this all sounds so boring?
06/01/2023, 19:59 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: Is just one meaningful connection enough, or do we need several, to keep us from feeling lonely?
06/01/2023, 19:59 - Annie: Both.

Enjoy the weekend fellow banters!!

06/01/2023, 22:06 - Oladoke: I don’t think the number is what counts nor connection, I think if we are comfortable being ourself around at least one other person, then you are sharing who you are with them. 

I think loneliness comes from a lack of being able share who we are. 

I heard a saying a few months ago… when we share our pain, it gets divided and when we share our happiness, it is multiplied. I’m not sure about the arithmetic of it all but something about it resonates with me
06/01/2023, 22:08 - Oladoke: But there are also pains we would rather not share, but may be that’s because of fear of judgement or rejection
06/01/2023, 22:17 - Alba: I see your point when you are comfortable with that person with your and his or her flaws and you can be vulnerable the emotional connection is bigger .
06/01/2023, 22:21 - Oladoke: True story - I overheard a young man chatting up a woman and after getting through the pleasantries, she asked waist do you do? He responded, I’m jobless and carried on talking. The moment she realised he was serious about being jobless, her guard dropped. I think there is something about  being open or sharing who you are that reminds people - this is just another human being like me, trying to get by
06/01/2023, 22:37 - Alba: The moment you can be open and emotional with someone if that person loves as you are and accept you is wonderful 🧘‍♀️🤣 
But unfortunately it doesn’t happen often n a town of 3 million single people full of possibilities
06/01/2023, 22:48 - Alba: Did you  watch something nice in Neftlix/Amazon recently ?
07/01/2023, 12:06 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: Vulnerability is a good way to connect....to make friends, bond, support, to trust...but comes with its own risks.  😑
07/01/2023, 13:51 - Oladoke: Yep, I was going to add that. But there is nothing wrong opening up slowly.
07/01/2023, 13:52 - Oladoke: I watched a couple of shows but find myself going back to the 80s for films
07/01/2023, 15:07 - Alba: A sexy band for fun moments ;)

07/01/2023, 15:49 - Alba: Preparing PSHE lessons
08/01/2023, 14:13 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: There's a netflix movie (name escapes me), about a conman.. (a car sales man)..pretending to be MI5 undercover...winnings over trust, and controlling his  victims, getting money from them. 

But in normal day-to-day interactions, opening up _to make new friends_, as you say, should be gradual, and on mutual terms. 

Just this year alone i had to block 3 contacts (2 F & 1 M). 😄... all 3 pretending to "wanna make friends".. but so (comically) amateurish in their modus operandi. 🤦🏻‍♂️
08/01/2023, 14:14 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: The movie is based on true events from i think the 00s.
08/01/2023, 17:40 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: Can't find season #1
08/01/2023, 18:17 - Oladoke: Click episodes and seasons
08/01/2023, 18:22 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: <Media omitted>
08/01/2023, 18:49 - Oladoke: It is usually at the bottom
08/01/2023, 18:49 - Oladoke: I think they invert it, to make you watch newer shows first
08/01/2023, 21:30 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: Seen "MADOFF: The Monster of Wall Street" on Netflix yet?

https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/81466159?s=a&trkid=13747225&t=wha&vlang=en&clip=81648718
08/01/2023, 22:25 - Oladoke: No, any good ?
08/01/2023, 23:02 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: 👍🏼👍🏼...quite interesting!!
09/01/2023, 12:26 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: I would be very keen on knowing why he did this?

His behaviour is typical of a psychopath (financial victims, not real people).

He showed signs of wanting to get caught.
He exonerated everyone around him.
He did show remorse, for his family, but not his victims.
09/01/2023, 20:02 - Alba: Shall we do one philosophy social event in half term or so?
09/01/2023, 20:02 - Alba: 😉🥰🤞🍀
09/01/2023, 20:03 - Alba: Scary 😧
09/01/2023, 20:05 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: Yes, quite scary. Psychopaths who don't realise their compulsion, are the worse.
But i think he did.
09/01/2023, 20:39 - Oladoke: What happened to our salsa night we were planning?
11/01/2023, 07:13 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: https://www.instagram.com/reel/CmPJihNjy-L/?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y=
12/01/2023, 15:25 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: What do you all think of Andrew Tate and his media influence...there were brief reports on CNN & UK Parliament about his misogynistic msg...and arrest in Romania for human trafficking.
12/01/2023, 15:38 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: While i think he's a conman... 😄.. sm1 i know is heavily influenced by Tate. Says Tate is inspirational & there is a conspiracy to bring him down.
12/01/2023, 17:35 - +44 7507 577140: Thats quite Blade Runner
12/01/2023, 18:43 - Alba: Yay
12/01/2023, 18:44 - Alba: My friend Dave just have a date in front on my face 🤣I am in his place and he with a girl 😅🙃🥲 I mean I’m too traditional being able to be a free spirit ? 😀⭐️ I don’t mind fwb but not in your face
12/01/2023, 18:44 - Alba: Some people taught me about poliamory but not sure if it’s a wonderful idea  💡
12/01/2023, 18:44 - Alba: Perhaps I just need to let it go
12/01/2023, 18:45 - Alba: https://youtu.be/JISlh7et1w4
12/01/2023, 18:45 - Alba: I’m glad I found a flat
12/01/2023, 18:46 - Alba: I work Sunday today night nanny and tomorrow school 🏫. Not anymore .
12/01/2023, 19:20 - Alba: I agree with Shin perhaps you can love more than one people at once but perhaps I’ll be a hopeless romantic ? There is love in the heart of the city? Sometimes ..
12/01/2023, 19:26 - Alba: I miss you people . Let’s do a social in half term or after ;)
12/01/2023, 19:27 - Alba: 😊😌😎🤩Who would like to join? Or another philo group if this is in stand by? Are you going to Parag’s?
14/01/2023, 11:07 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: 👍🏼...overall... perhaps our ideas do converge if the information provided is the same...but differences in experiences will contribute to divergence of thoughts.. no?
14/01/2023, 11:09 - Gareth: Of course. I think it’s more about whether we should deliberately avoid some information
14/01/2023, 12:07 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: Personally...i think information should be available... 
Is there information that could be harmful?.... bio-weapons?
14/01/2023, 12:13 - Will-hazzer777: Or any kind of weapon at all...
14/01/2023, 12:13 - Will-hazzer777: Information however can't be suppressed forever. The means of production however can be suppressed for much longer.
14/01/2023, 12:14 - Will-hazzer777: Well it's a good thing we're not in an echo chamber in here!
14/01/2023, 12:18 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: What about information that does not rely on means of production...eg. how to influence an election or state censorship?
14/01/2023, 12:20 - Gareth: Perhaps there are so positive aspects of an echo chamber
14/01/2023, 12:26 - Will-hazzer777: <Media omitted>
14/01/2023, 12:27 - Will-hazzer777: So long as it is a practical, self re-enforcing echo.. like the Amish and Menonites I'm all for it... They keep themselves to themselves.. don't trouble anybody and live insular but probably content lives.
14/01/2023, 12:33 - Gareth: Looks AI generated
14/01/2023, 12:35 - Will-hazzer777: Al is a great guy.
14/01/2023, 12:36 - Will-hazzer777: He tells me everything I want to hear.
14/01/2023, 12:37 - Will-hazzer777: Dave and Tyrone are good guys too. 😉
14/01/2023, 14:54 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: The Good Life: Lessons From the World’s Longest Scientific Study on Happiness (Simon and Schuster; January 10, 2023).
Robert Waldinger is a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, director of the Harvard Study of Adult Development at Massachusetts General Hospital, and cofounder of the Lifespan Research Foundation.
15/01/2023, 06:39 - Will-hazzer777: Summary of findings? 😁
15/01/2023, 09:40 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: 2000 people have been followed through their early years to death...and follow up study of their children. North American. 1938 start.

Work, relationships, health, etc variables studied.

-We are bad at anticipating what makes us happy. 
-Quality of relationships strong predictor of happiness - positive relationships regulate emotions
-Good health (low alcohol, more exercise)
-Love the work one does or enjoy the coworkers
-Income not related to happiness 
-Invest in smt beyond yourself. (The happiest person in the cohort was a teacher)
-50% genetically determined 
-Window for new friendships/love never closes in life
-Seek experiences over things
-Walking keeps our brains active.
-Dog better than cat, as pet.
-Having children reduces quality of Marital life
....
15/01/2023, 14:05 - Gareth: That last one is deceptive eh?
15/01/2023, 14:11 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: https://www.newscientist.com/article/2213655-having-kids-makes-you-happier-but-only-when-they-move-out/
15/01/2023, 15:06 - Gareth: Happiness is a poor metric
15/01/2023, 15:06 - Gareth: In this specific instance
15/01/2023, 15:06 - Gareth: Unhappiness reasonably positive
15/01/2023, 15:07 - Will-hazzer777: Happiness is over rated
15/01/2023, 15:08 - Will-hazzer777: Especially when it's 50% genetically determined.
15/01/2023, 15:08 - Will-hazzer777: Just make sure your not unhappy.
16/01/2023, 14:03 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: BTW... does anyone here believe that the lockdown was orchestrated by the bigtech for their profits? 
I've know sm1 who insists, but i wanna have another independent view, with the same position. That big tech controls CV19 infection data and is pro-lockdown. 
🤦🏻‍♂️🙄
16/01/2023, 14:23 - Oladoke: What do you mean ?
16/01/2023, 14:24 - Will-hazzer777: If the way your brain is wired up is 50% determined by genetics then it is most likely that your emotional life is half determined by genetics.
16/01/2023, 14:27 - Oladoke: I’m not sure it works like that. People’s gauge of happiness is usually based on preference of living or perspective. I would say environment and self awareness
16/01/2023, 14:36 - Will-hazzer777: https://www.trackinghappiness.com/50-40-10-rule-of-happiness/
16/01/2023, 14:38 - Oladoke: Did you actually read the link yourself ?
16/01/2023, 14:39 - Oladoke: It says clearly at the top the rule is not based on any data
16/01/2023, 14:40 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: 50% ...that was based on data.
Data from 2000 individuals tracked over 80-smt years.
16/01/2023, 14:42 - Oladoke: People override how they feel through self development, so how important is genetics if it can be overridden
16/01/2023, 14:48 - Gareth: It’s more than 50%
16/01/2023, 14:57 - Oladoke: But that’s my issue. In such circumstances, the constant should be ignored. Except you are saying people have no control over their happiness.

So if we say your happiness is determined by 90% genetics. What should you do?
16/01/2023, 15:02 - Oladoke: I know people who suffer from severe depressions and in most cases, it’s heredity. But even those people learn ways to manage it with techniques
16/01/2023, 15:08 - Gareth: Worry about the 10%
16/01/2023, 15:08 - Gareth: Point is that they need to manage it
16/01/2023, 15:09 - Gareth: That’s what heredity means
16/01/2023, 15:09 - Gareth: If they didn’t inherit it they wouldn’t need to manage it
16/01/2023, 15:12 - Gareth: For example - people who are tall need to duck under some doors. They are not doomed to walking into door frames.
16/01/2023, 16:56 - Oladoke: But that’s the same for everyone. In everything, heredity comes into play. If you are born with a timid and shy character, you need to manage it. Everyone in life plays with the cards you are dealt with. Same with those born with with great aesthetics. If you are an unattractive person, you lean on other skills. If not, you also have to contend with superficiality in a different context e.g. most people objectifying you
16/01/2023, 16:57 - Oladoke: Either way, we are all aiming for the promise land of happiness or being fulfilled, however you define it
16/01/2023, 16:58 - Gareth: Exactly?
16/01/2023, 16:59 - Alba: Hi lovely people ! I need to lead 2 assemblies and 2 church per week in my school. Do you think this is Stand up comedy ? 😂🧘‍♀️❤️🍀Hope in peace? 🙃 I laughed a lot with this video hopefully not tomorrow in the church . 
https://youtu.be/gTYPHw22eeo
16/01/2023, 17:02 - Alba: No, I believe happiness is the hability of having sense of humour , keep your positive aspects and smile in spite of the circumstances. I was in the most dramatic and I always tried to laugh , when kids tried to suicide in SEN centres , caothic people mugged you .. You could be biologically fucked with the depression but you need to be a warrior and have well-being habits to survive, nice social circles and enjoy your work or free time  .
16/01/2023, 17:04 - Alba: Now I don’t enjoy my job but I keep going with Hope . And a fake faith. 65% Muslims for CE of England . They have more well-being and mindfulness I’ve ever seen in my life 😂💪🏻🧘‍♀️🍀 For poor people it works and Christians have some nice values too. 
I’m improving to be open-minded .
16/01/2023, 17:11 - Alba: Are you people with COViD or flu this winter too? My colleagues and me we were sick 😷 but we have hope and we need to go to work to pay bills 😂🧘‍♀️🍀❤️
16/01/2023, 17:13 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: I had CV19 around Xmas,  but just 2 days. Quite mild.
18/01/2023, 20:51 - Alba: Do you know other philosophy groups are running still? And where ?
19/01/2023, 00:22 - Oladoke: The Saturday park one is open for those looking to freeze 

If you prefer more cosy settings, we still have the Southwark pub event
19/01/2023, 10:57 - Will-hazzer777: What happened to Parag? One? And Austin's?
19/01/2023, 14:02 - +44 7931 083103: Thibk they're both still going

20/01/2023, 10:38 - Ali changed the group description
20/01/2023, 10:38 - Ali: The next social is in the description if in future you need address etc.
20/01/2023, 13:11 - Will-hazzer777: Totally
20/01/2023, 16:16 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: Have you guys looked into WhatsApp Communities? 
It allows you to merge multiple chat groups.. so you could have philo-bants, philo-smt, philo-smt-else.. and you request to join any, and then can post/read all the msg. 

I'm with one such where they have 24 groups, i  the community. 🤷🏻‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️
Similar to Discourse i guess.
20/01/2023, 16:45 - Will-hazzer777: Mmm I think it might be better to leave things as they are...
20/01/2023, 18:04 - Alba: Buff my landlord gave me 4 week notice

23/01/2023, 22:39 - Alba: Poliamory works?
23/01/2023, 22:39 - Alba: What do you think?
23/01/2023, 22:41 - Alba: ❤️🍀🤸🏄‍♀️ Shin I want you to explain to me your perspective. 
Perhaps being more open-minded I can understand you can love and have relationships or fwb can give you more pleasure (not sure about the safety part after checking lots of illnesses just in students files in students in College e.g. ) and less headaches than a true love or romantic old fashioned way?
23/01/2023, 23:04 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: I'm no expert, ...but i think people prefer different types of connections...🤷🏻‍♂️😊
For some it works. For others it fails.
23/01/2023, 23:29 - +358 44 9508331: For what it's worth, I know a handful of polyamorous people who've been doing it for several years, and it seems to work for them. Doesn't have to be fwb or somehow more superficial than monoamorous relationships, it can range from pure sex to deeply committed long term loving relationships with kids and all.
23/01/2023, 23:31 - +358 44 9508331: Definitely requires more care when it comes to STDs, you do want to be smart about that
23/01/2023, 23:34 - +358 44 9508331: The one thing I keep hearing from them a lot is that just because it's polyamorous doesn't mean there aren't rules. One should always be clear with everyone about what the rules are, and breaking them is treated like cheating. At least my friends tend to have the rule that all partners should be aware of each other.
23/01/2023, 23:35 - +358 44 9508331: Also, they don't claim that they never get jealous. They claim that jealousy in relationships is something you practice and learn to process and handle and dismantle.

24/01/2023, 22:10 - Alba: Do you like Frohm? Fromm states that "Love is an active power in a man", and that in the general sense, the active character of love is primarily that of "giving". He further delineates what he views as the four core tenets of love: care, responsibility, respect, and knowledge.
24/01/2023, 22:11 - Alba: Am I too innocent and hopeless romantic for a resilient epicurean Londoner ?
24/01/2023, 22:16 - Alba: Sometimes I think I’m too pure to live in London. My parents educated me to be a role model so maybe I’m too boring, sorry 😂

25/01/2023, 19:05 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: Yes..🙂...doesn't look real...even at first glance..but if this is how it is in 2023....🫣
25/01/2023, 21:06 - Oladoke: If you are boring then then we are all mannequins
26/01/2023, 10:00 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: Not _all_... 😅😅
26/01/2023, 11:01 - Ali: ✨ANNOUNCEMENT ✨
I have booked 2 tables at Ye Olde Cheshire Cheese pub for Saturday 28th January at 1pm (I was unable to book it for 3pm unfortunately). 

It's usually a quiet pub (minus us) so i'm sure there will be more space available if you want to hop on the Philosophy pub social. 

Heres the website with address -  https://ye-olde-cheshire-cheese.co.uk 

I've booked 2 tables under 'Alison'. Both are in the 'Williams Room'. It's a great pub steeped in history, they also do food. I hope you can make it! At the moment i have around 8 people coming along. Would be great to see you there😁
26/01/2023, 17:25 - Alba: Wondeful ! I’ll try to go. 
Do you have these thingy with recruiters they are worse than guys who want to date you? ☝️💜🥰🤸 What kind of energy or enthusiasm you need to become a recruiter ?
28/01/2023, 09:27 - Ali: Today is the day of the pub social. Who’s coming?

28/01/2023, 13:26 - Ali: We will be downstairs. Don’t ask for my name for the table. Waste of time. Just go downstairs for the drinks
28/01/2023, 13:35 - Alba: I don’t find you
28/01/2023, 13:35 - Alba: Haha

31/01/2023, 16:07 - Will-hazzer777: I think it's on discord I believe, no?
31/01/2023, 16:09 - Will-hazzer777: Based on what I can see... Nobody has added anything to the discord chat for a week or more.

02/02/2023, 18:07 - Alba: The landlord worst
02/02/2023, 18:09 - Alba: Shin how do you call it ? Bugdug? 😂🧘‍♀️How do you spell it ? Lazy non working man living and taking advantage of  others super hard working class ?
02/02/2023, 23:05 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: 🤔...not sure what you mean...

A _Roman-dick_ lover.😅

Join me at East London Film Club 029 / Her https://meetu.ps/e/LJs77/zjtn8/i
14/02/2023, 19:41 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: Best ever Valentine movie...
14/02/2023, 19:42 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: Meet Joe Black
14/02/2023, 19:57 - Will-hazzer777: Why makes it specifically a Valentine's movie and not just a romantic movie?
14/02/2023, 20:01 - Will-hazzer777: *what
14/02/2023, 20:01 - Will-hazzer777: I suppose any romantic movie could be a valentine's movie but is there something specific at all?
14/02/2023, 20:09 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: This one demonstrates the various types of romances all in one:
True romance (Joe and the pretty girl)
Parental romance (Dad and two daughters)
Emotional attachment to life's work - sort of romantic (Parish Comm).
Fake romance (Pretty girl and fiance Drew)
...and finally death wins. 😌
14/02/2023, 20:10 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: Which is by in itself...romantic! ♥️
15/02/2023, 07:44 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: ... and this movie is about the biggest of all romances...

Death romancing life! 😉♥️

17/02/2023, 15:00 - Will-hazzer777: It's less to do with culture and more to do with the psyche and physic of the average person in a group.
17/02/2023, 17:50 - Oladoke: Is that not the framework of culture
17/02/2023, 17:50 - Oladoke: ?
17/02/2023, 17:50 - Oladoke: Are we in charge of our own minds or is allowing things into our minds the only control we have?
17/02/2023, 17:57 - Annie: Or the lack of culture.
17/02/2023, 18:03 - Oladoke: But you cannot disapprove of a groups culture based on your standards because that invalidates yours automatically

17/02/2023, 18:41 - Will-hazzer777: Female participation in very physically active and dangerous contests I'd assume is more likely to happen when women in those parts of the world are more robust.
17/02/2023, 19:37 - Oladoke: Robust indeed
17/02/2023, 20:20 - Annie: But you can.
17/02/2023, 20:22 - Annie: The lack of culture within context, is not being exposed to any manipulation of the mind.
17/02/2023, 20:26 - Annie: In other words, violent bitches.
17/02/2023, 21:45 - Ali: Aww so nice to hear from you
17/02/2023, 21:48 - Annie: 😄😚
17/02/2023, 22:25 - Oladoke: That’s contradicts itself. The fundamental medium of culture is word of mouth or peer learning. If that’s not external manipulation, I’m not sure what is.

It’s always funny when I hear “uncultured” from the west. It wasn’t that long ago people were being treated like animals and are still are in a many situations. It’s sort of like a drug addict who has been clean for 2 weeks health shaming people for eating a burger 😅
17/02/2023, 22:54 - Will-hazzer777: Culture is relative to the environment and temperament of the people. The Europeans didn't like some of the practices that they saw when they went around the world. E.g. the practice of widow burning in India or cannibalism in Papua New Guinea, child marriage or just plain bare breasted nudity of various people's around the world. 

I personally think the Europeans shouldn't have got involved in enforcing the cessation of these cultural practices or done any direct development work in any other part of the world - it's only caused more trouble for their descendants down the line.
17/02/2023, 22:58 - Oladoke: Exactly my point, people will always find something they don’t like looking in someone’s house
17/02/2023, 23:03 - Will-hazzer777: Yeah... It's not in my taste. I feel sorry for the wildebeest when it's being hunted and killed by a lion but should I get involved? No, that's the circle of life. Different people do things differently in different parts of the world. If they want to copy the west (as the Japanese did) then good luck to them that's their choice... But telling them that the should do things this way or that isn't our business e.g. human rights. 

That's very much a kin to the Christian missionary position that many western powers took which was a mistake.
18/02/2023, 09:37 - Alba: Yeah, we said the other day in Parag’s group  we miss you ❤️ !! Did you travel in half term?
18/02/2023, 10:04 - Annie: Miss you all too.   
No travel this half-term.   
Hope you had fun.

22/02/2023, 13:48 - Will-hazzer777: Good one 👍
24/02/2023, 15:08 - Alba: Beautiful people, would you like to do a social sooner or later ?
24/02/2023, 15:09 - Alba: 🙂🥰🧘‍♀️ 🎹
25/02/2023, 23:12 - Oladoke: https://youtu.be/yrKYzV-TUsg
25/02/2023, 23:22 - Oladoke: Probably not a nice question but why do we think some missing individuals get so much focus over the other hundred of thousands of people?
26/02/2023, 17:59 - Gareth: I think you have answered your own question./
26/02/2023, 17:59 - Gareth: It is much easier to care about an individual
27/02/2023, 00:21 - Will-hazzer777: Some individuals have more mystery about their disappearance. If some have a high unlikelihood of something like that happening because it's very much out of character and there's no potential motive for their disappearance (no history of being involved in gangs, no family problems, no history of mental health issues, no truancy, no history of having gone missing before etc...a potential murder or kidnapping story also is more intriguing) there's going to be more publicity surrounding it. The sex and age of a missing individual also plays a role. Missing men aren't much considered, missing women with no history of problems however are going to attract more attention, especially if they're considered good looking.
27/02/2023, 07:33 - Oladoke: ?
27/02/2023, 07:34 - Oladoke: But it’s not just a gender difference but also a social class difference
27/02/2023, 07:36 - Oladoke: E.g. Madeline
27/02/2023, 07:52 - Will-hazzer777: This might just be due to her being a child and her disappearance occurring rather mysteriously whilst on holiday. It'd be interesting to hear of a case similar to it that didn't have coverage.
27/02/2023, 08:53 - +358 44 9508331: There could also be a lot of randomness in it. Once one news source decides to make a thing out of someone's disappearance, for whatever random reason, it may inspire other news sources to do the same, especially since the first source has already done much of the investigative work for them. And once enough has been written about a case that in itself makes it news, and then more will get written about it.
27/02/2023, 09:57 - Oladoke: I’m not sure people know how many people go missing, 500,000 in the US alone in 2021
27/02/2023, 10:00 - Oladoke: This comedy piece touches on it a little
27/02/2023, 10:00 - Oladoke: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnJ1Q5rHv8k
27/02/2023, 10:01 - Oladoke: Like all comedians, he did exaggerate but you can get his drift
27/02/2023, 10:52 - Will-hazzer777: To be fair the demographics of the western world, for now means that there are more white people that go missing than non-white, because there just are more white people than any other racial group. So all things being equal, and each case had equal likelihood of making national or international headlines it's most likely going to be a story about a white person. 

Locally, say in London in general or e.g. in Tower Hamlets or Newham more specifically, if a news outlet reports on a local missing person, it's most likely the story is going to be about non-white person, because there are more non-white people in those areas.
27/02/2023, 11:38 - Oladoke: It’s more how media focus on it
27/02/2023, 11:39 - Oladoke: So it’s not the number of missing but those focused on
27/02/2023, 13:10 - Will-hazzer777: Well it's like a dog with a bone... Once they've started with a missing person story they run away with it especially if it's never resolved e.g. Madeline McCann
27/02/2023, 15:35 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: "Religion has been on the decline in America for years. But last year, for the first time in American history, house-of-worship membership dropped below 50%. And nowhere is the decline in religion and faith more dramatic than when you look at the youngest generation. 
Gen Z is the most likely generation ever to say they don’t believe in God, and they are the least religiously affiliated and the least likely to attend church".
- Bari Weiss, Honestly
03/03/2023, 08:34 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: We have all watched the sitcom Friends. 
The producers/writers had more than just the comedy in mind. They had some very educational & interesting relationship insights built into the series... 
When psychoanalysts take the characters apart, a good majority of us would identify ourselves with 1-2 characters... with attachments, boundaries, control, insecurity, being lonely, etc etc

It's a 24min video, but i recommend it. ... Enjoy! ☺️😇

You don’t enjoy with this classy people wasting so much money on a Sat night 😂🧘‍♀️And coming back
20/03/2023, 21:37 - Alba: I laughed a lot about this one . They are very mainstream . They said : don't have hope , look at Seneca, suicide is always an option 😂🤪🤓🧐😔

25/03/2023, 23:36 - Alba: Do you want someone help you to organise a meet up all together ? I am up for it .
25/03/2023, 23:40 - Alba: We could do each 6 weeks as you thought and every of these 6 weeks one person could help you and Gareth. And maybe we could vote if we prefer : 
Pub 
Live music 
Meet 🆙 tango class 
Restaurant 
Park 
Wetherspoons 
Michael soirée if he wants 
Etc🎾 Just bc you’re so busy and it’s a shame we loose connections and friendships as before .

Happy Friday all! 

It’s time to get on the banter bus. I am planning a little philo gathering on *Saturday 13th May. * 🍻

I was thinking of us all meeting at a cute pub - *Ye Olde Mitre* (one of the oldest pubs in London) from 2pm onwards and later (possibly!) travel to Angel 👼 for some FREE comedy at either *The Bill Murray* or *Camden Head* for 5/6pm (we would have to get there early to ensure we all get in). 

For those interested.. please react to this post with an emoji of your choice, so I’ve got your name down. AND paleeeeze make sure you make a note of the date somewhere. I will check in with you all nearer the time.

Hope you can make it!

27/04/2023, 21:14 - Ali: I think tbh its more like you find those things. Life doesnt come to you
28/04/2023, 16:41 - Gareth: Or notice them first perhaps?
28/04/2023, 16:42 - Gareth: A sort of bias

09/05/2023, 23:51 - Ali: Will officially announce a time etc once I’ve booked some tables and confirmed the pub. Will probably meet around 2 or 3pm on Saturday
10/05/2023, 13:07 - Ali: ✨UPDATE ✨

As some of you already know, I am planning a little philo gathering this Saturday - *Saturday 13th May. * 🍻

Slight change of plan.. [_PUB CHANGE]._

From 2pm onwards the plan is to meet at The Seven Stars - in Holborn (one of the oldest pubs in London) from 2pm onwards. Unfortunately I’m unable to book a table so hopefully there will be room for all of us! If not - we will find a plan B. 

Then later (possibly!) travel to Angel 👼 for some FREE comedy at either *The Bill Murray* or *Camden Head* for 5/6pm (we would have to get there early to ensure we all get in). Alternatively we could find somewhere to watch Eurovision - all depending on what everyone feels like at the time. 

There is around 8 of us now, so please react to this post with an emoji if you fancy it - as it would be helpful to know how many to expect on the day. 

I hope you can make it and it would be great to see you!

12/05/2023, 17:21 - Oladoke: Fortunately or unfortunately it won’t get to the bootycall. The love doesn’t decent lower than the stomach
12/05/2023, 17:22 - Oladoke: But there’s no cheating the system, a gate keeper always gets his due
12/05/2023, 18:56 - Alba: It’s not only food . The other day I was in a pub with a professor and one couple had just for them 10 drinks in the table without starting ⭐️

Although you may not be dating the same guy... someone in the group of 46,000 members, _might have_ dated your current dare... and so, the girls can get together ☺️.. nice and comfy, ... get to know the (umassuming) guy ...figure out his stories, lies, etc...and have a laugh!! 
😅😅
13/05/2023, 09:59 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: Or even better... if you find out your date is double dating you, and you get to know his other girl, through here, ... you could seriously have a great time messing with the guy!! 😅😅
13/05/2023, 12:09 - Gareth: That sounds a bit off
13/05/2023, 13:33 - Alba: I’m late too
13/05/2023, 14:00 - Oladoke: What’s the point. If you think someone is dodgy enough to join such a group then don’t date them
13/05/2023, 14:06 - Ali: We’re outside the pub.
13/05/2023, 14:25 - Alba: Are you in the pub then I’ll be around 3ish

18/05/2023, 10:12 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: Have you ever wondered about your relationship with money.... how it impacts you as a person, your life, your decisions, what factors have shaped that relationship, etc?
18/05/2023, 10:16 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: I have never heard a discussion about this.

People talk about sex, dreams, work, holidays, kink, ...and yet... i think the most taboo subject is our relationship with money.
18/05/2023, 10:20 - Ali: Funny you should mention that Shin. I was thinking at 10am - the same question!!
18/05/2023, 10:20 - Ali: How we deal with money can make or break relationships too.
18/05/2023, 10:24 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: Why at 10am...were you spending on Amazon??... 😅😅
18/05/2023, 10:25 - Ali: No I was tidying my flat 😆 and it randomly popped into my head and I was thinking… that’s odd.
18/05/2023, 10:26 - Ali: So so trueeeee
18/05/2023, 10:27 - Ali: I think if you can base your first date without money involved - it’s a good place to start. Because we aren’t woo’d by money. We actually get to know that person.
18/05/2023, 10:28 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: So it _is_ important matter...not *money*,... but how we relate to it.
18/05/2023, 10:28 - Ali: Definitely.
18/05/2023, 10:29 - Ali: I think there are some women who go on dates just for the free meal and drinks.. now if the date was a walk along the canal or something, I wonder how it would change
18/05/2023, 10:29 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: Is generosity a weakness or strength...of character? 
Is (as they say), "close to your money", frugal, a weakness or a strength?..and why so?
18/05/2023, 10:30 - Ali: Generosity when it comes to money, is a weakness I think.
18/05/2023, 10:31 - Ali: Maybe not a weakness but potentially a blind spot. Because you can’t buy people’s love and affection with money. They will use and abuse you and drop you when the money stops.
18/05/2023, 10:31 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: Are there different types of generous characters: which ones?
Generous with love/affection?
Generous with my time?

But generosity with money is the only generosity that is measurable,... and comparable.
18/05/2023, 10:32 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: Are the different generosities all related... ?
18/05/2023, 10:33 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: Would a generous partner manage a health relationship with a stingy one?
18/05/2023, 10:36 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: Money is abstract.
At what age do we associate with this abstract entity?
What shapes that association?
Does it form us as we grow?
Would that association (with money,), change...over time? Or with environment/partner?
18/05/2023, 10:47 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: When would a decision/behaviour involving money matters sound wierd to you (what's your definition of health relationship to money)
18/05/2023, 10:50 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: Is it that our relationship with money says so much about us that we have (subconsciously), collectively decided to leave it out.
18/05/2023, 21:51 - Alba: When is pride?
20/05/2023, 07:45 - Oladoke: https://www.instagram.com/reel/CsHf5pbIFTB/?igshid=NTc4MTIwNjQ2YQ==

21/05/2023, 00:48 - Alba: I was in the Joel park and Joel kicked Kim him out when I arrived .. It was miserable . 
In Greenwich now. 🙃
21/05/2023, 08:47 - Gareth: Kicked who out?
21/05/2023, 10:42 - Alba: Joel kicked Kim :( 
Classic. 
Haha
21/05/2023, 10:42 - Alba: Have a nice cloudy 🌥 day !
21/05/2023, 11:15 - +44 7474 783050: Do you know why Joel kicked him out? I was in a group with Kim, and he was doing well, with good arguments, etc. I noticed that Kim left but didn't know Joel kicked him out
21/05/2023, 11:21 - Will-hazzer777: I don't know anything about this situation but Joel is Joel and we've all found out what he's like... He doesn't tolerate a significant difference of opinion, especially if it has any empirical backing.
21/05/2023, 19:40 - Gareth: What would empiricism have to do with it?
21/05/2023, 19:41 - Gareth: The main thing Joel doesn’t approve of is people who try to change the way his activities work.
21/05/2023, 19:41 - Gareth: My first guess would be something subversive or disruptive
21/05/2023, 19:47 - Jake: very true.
21/05/2023, 19:48 - Jake: or perhaps someone just tried to use empirical evidence to support their argument, which was found to be verbotten
21/05/2023, 19:48 - Gareth: It is an example of one of the things he doesn’t tolerate.
21/05/2023, 19:49 - Jake: no disagreement there!
21/05/2023, 20:11 - Alba: Yeah you were out too
21/05/2023, 20:12 - Alba: :(
21/05/2023, 20:15 - Ali: No comment

24/05/2023, 17:11 - Alba: Yeah maybe I don’t have kids so I can spend money in friends or lovers but they get overwhelmed if I buy them lots of gifts ☺️😂🙌
Last Sunday I delivered flowers 💐 and wine 🍷 for my friend after seeing him at the weekend . 🎻
24/05/2023, 19:12 - Alba: Join me at Stompin' at the 100 Club https://meetu.ps/e/LZz7w/zjtn8/i

Choose 
1)Sunday free Salsa Barbican. 
2) Monday free swing .
24/05/2023, 23:28 - Oladoke: Overwhelmed? Sounds like you’re catering to the wrong love language 😅 the homeless guy won’t complain, and you know what they say about homeless men
24/05/2023, 23:53 - Alba: Yep they don’t like it. 
But with my twin 💫 flame is fine he’s used to my random presents 🎁 and he invites me for breakfast 🥞 or dinner  sometimes 🥘 :)
24/05/2023, 23:54 - Alba: We’re going to the Dali experience on Sat . He’s growing his moustache 🥸😌😏😂🙌

25/05/2023, 13:47 - Alba: Yesterday they had free lunch and I ate three desserts 🍨

04/06/2023, 16:22 - Alba: Mate 🧉 is cycling 🚴🏻‍♀️ Speakers corner and pub if someone fancy joins my girl and me
04/06/2023, 16:23 - Alba: Maybe we go dancing later I’m a bit  overdressed
04/06/2023, 22:56 - Oladoke: Where? Temple?
05/06/2023, 00:50 - Alba: We went to a Jogo Jam Session in Dalston at the end! And we danced a loot !
06/06/2023, 17:05 - Oladoke: What type of music?
07/06/2023, 17:59 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: Sat 17th... Frisbee, volleyball, BBQ?
07/06/2023, 18:07 - Ali: I was gonna organise a gathering for that day. I reckon a BBQ could be fun!
07/06/2023, 18:07 - Ali: In the park like before?
07/06/2023, 18:07 - Ali: Unless you want to organise it this time @⁨🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine⁩ ?
07/06/2023, 18:36 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: I'll bring a Frisbee. 😎
07/06/2023, 21:48 - Annie: Hello darlings.  
Great idea but I can't make it. 😞 
Defo the next one!
07/06/2023, 21:50 - Ali: Shall I organise it then? I don’t mind. We could have a backup pub which isn’t that Wetherspoons that everyone hates. Lol
07/06/2023, 21:53 - Alba: Lovely 🥰 You’re the best !
08/06/2023, 07:06 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: Conversely...during a friendly chat, if a person asks just 4 of the above, you could know/guess what their interests are in you. 😉😁
08/06/2023, 08:02 - Gareth: Smart
08/06/2023, 08:02 - Gareth: Can you imagine this conversation?!?
08/06/2023, 08:50 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: It might feel intrusive at time.
Some topics are awkward.

The most interesting bit about this conversation should be imho ...how free flowing & forthcoming is person A vs person B. 😊
08/06/2023, 09:32 - Ali: ✨ANNOUNCEMENT✨

It’s that Summertime feeling again for fun and friends ☀️ I am planning a little philo gathering on *Saturday 17th June*.

From 2pm til forever, we will meet at 
Highbury Fields (a 3 min walk from Highbury & Islington station) to have a picnic. If the weather is horrendous - then I will organise a pub instead (no not the usual Wetherspoons - I know how some of you complain about that pub!). For now I will set out the plan for a picnic! 

🎪 Games are welcome - frisbees, footballs, hula hoops, board games, boxing ring etc whatever you wanna bring with you. 🍔

🍉 It would be great if each of us can being some nibbles and drinks for us all to share. 🍻

Please react to this post with an emoji of your choice should you wish to come along and don’t forget to note it in your diary! 🦆 

I will post a reminder over the next week or so. 

See you there,

Ali x

What I didn’t know is that energy costs are closing licensed premises faster than COVID did

27/06/2023, 17:56 - Gareth: It’s bonkers
27/06/2023, 17:56 - Gareth: I think he’s having fun now
27/06/2023, 17:56 - Gareth: A listers, dreamlike stories
27/06/2023, 17:56 - Gareth: It’s just whatever fun he wants to have on the screen
27/06/2023, 18:12 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: Yes 😄...the new season is a bit "different"..
27/06/2023, 18:15 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: What i always loved about the series was that the intellectual concepts were really interesting...the stories went a different track...many times weak or disappointing..
27/06/2023, 18:17 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: I mean...the 1st 10 min of Joan is awful.
Imagine a parallel version of _all_ our lives, where we have a version of us with our true feels & views...🙈😄
27/06/2023, 18:51 - Gareth: Great episode
28/06/2023, 11:10 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: What do you think of my new quote: for dating and relationships

Behaviours...get us to keep"

30/06/2023, 11:48 - Annie: https://psyche.co/guides/how-to-start-having-more-fun-in-your-busy-life

Formula for fun?  

Have a lovely weekend, darlings.
30/06/2023, 14:56 - Oladoke: More fun? Aren't people having an excess of fun at the moment?
30/06/2023, 14:56 - Oladoke: 😅
30/06/2023, 18:56 - Annie: Why not. 
Fun is therapy. 😀
30/06/2023, 19:01 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: Nothing wrong in excess fun! 🥳☀️
30/06/2023, 19:13 - Oladoke: 😅 I like that
30/06/2023, 19:14 - Oladoke: Sure but sometimes it feels like a drug to not focus on issues at hand
30/06/2023, 19:17 - Annie: Actually, fun is a way of reconsidering the issues at hand from an objective perspective.   
So stop over analysing and get your fun hat on!
30/06/2023, 19:17 - +44 7507 577140: Which hand is giving you problems?
30/06/2023, 19:17 - Annie: 😀
30/06/2023, 19:18 - +44 7507 577140: I pulled a tendon near my little finger recently
30/06/2023, 19:18 - Annie: Ouch.
30/06/2023, 19:18 - +44 7507 577140: Not getting the attention i deserve for what is to the untrained eye not a very serious injury
30/06/2023, 19:41 - Annie: Glad to hear that  it's not a serious injury. 🤗
30/06/2023, 19:59 - Oladoke: Fair enough. So in the name of fun - what are you lot up to this evening ?
30/06/2023, 20:00 - Oladoke: 😅No Netflixing
30/06/2023, 20:17 - Annie: No way!  
The _net_ best thing?
30/06/2023, 22:03 - Oladoke: Nope
01/07/2023, 05:49 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: What do people do when money is not an issue?...
Have fun...the pursuit of happiness...☺️

But after a while... 
...the creative ones start inventing...(it's unstoppable).
...the humanitarian ones start putting smiles on other people's faces,  
....the self-serving ones over-induldge...
....the troubled ones ...🙈
01/07/2023, 08:49 - Annie: The troubled ones find happiness in the pursuit of money.
01/07/2023, 09:01 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: More money? 
Humm.... 🤔😁
01/07/2023, 11:03 - Oladoke: Maybe you could argue that’s in the pursuit of more fun or less hassle
01/07/2023, 11:04 - Oladoke: If you have climbed the highest mountain you look for the  next
01/07/2023, 11:35 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: But it's already a well-known socio-psychological fact... if our  savings go from 10k to 20k, we might be twice as happy.
But if it goes from 10 million to 20 million, the return on contentment or accomplishments or overall "experinced fullfilment" isn't doubled.

If you go on a lovely holiday for 6 days, versus 16 days, you will recollect it (the experienced holiday) as a shorter duration. 

There will always be a limit beyond which "more of the same", would have diminishing return... food, sex, sleep... company of good friends, family... everything! 

I think (just my subjective view) the exception would be creativity, problem solving.
05/07/2023, 17:43 - Oladoke: Thought the JP hangout was on today
05/07/2023, 17:43 - Oladoke: Let me know if anyone is in the city and fancies a drink

07/07/2023, 12:31 - Annie: Not really.  I was there about 3 weeks ago and it was fine.
07/07/2023, 12:33 - Annie: Aw, next time then.🍺
07/07/2023, 12:34 - Annie: If anyone is available to join me from 2.30pm to about 6ish, that would be great.   
If not,I will just have to settle for my local pub.
07/07/2023, 13:35 - Ali: What a lovely invite! Thanks. Would have loved to come and see youuuuu but I am working. Have fun! Xxx

My grandparents have lived a long life using these “harmful products”, my grandad has lead pipes in his cottage where the drinking water comes out of.. he’s fine. My grandmother is 92 and has eaten junk food and used nivea most of her life.. she’s still alive and kicking! <This message was edited>
30/08/2023, 11:51 - Ali: All of these “I’m not going to eat that because it’s bad for you” “I’m not going to use that because it’s bad for you” is a bit of an over reaction I think… everything in moderation. If you’re ingesting Nivea cream all day - then yes you probably will die sooner. If all you’re eating is meat and nothing else - then yer probably you’ll have some issues. If you consume philosophy 24/7 you’ll probably end up killing yourself.. 😅🤪
30/08/2023, 12:06 - Alba: Yeah it’s a bit overreacting . 
My grandparents live long lives too with a healthier life and very active . 
You have nice gens 😍😌

He soon recovered, and credited his recovery to Vaseline"

His eats a burger and chips every night. Never exercises and seems stressed like hell. 😄
01/09/2023, 08:32 - Will-hazzer777: His diet sounds a bit like Warren buffet's one...

"The 92-year-old chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway recently told CNBC's "Squawk Box" that he'd be willing to forgo an extra year of his life for the ability to eat however he pleases.
...

He's said before that he drinks five cans of Coke a day and told Fortune in 2015 that he's "one-quarter Coca-Cola." Buffett has also said he frequents McDonald's daily for breakfast, always getting one of three items: two sausage patties; a sausage, egg, and cheese McMuffin; or a bacon, egg, and cheese biscuit.

Microsoft cofounder Bill Gates, a longtime friend of Buffett's, said in 2016 that Buffett "mostly eats hamburgers, ice cream, and Coke" and recalled that he once "opened up a package of Oreos to eat for breakfast" when staying over at Gates' house."

19/09/2023, 16:28 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: The A380 is the largest and heaviest passenger aircraft in the world. It is 73 meters long, 24 meters high, and has a takeoff weight of up to 560 tons. The Lufthansa A380 seats *509 passengers, 250 more passengers than the 747*, and fly for up to 20 hours without refueling.

The A380 production ended due to a lack of demand; the company had 17 orders in the backlog. After Emirates cut its A380 order by 39 aircraft, leaving just 14 on the backlog, the final decision was reached to terminate production on the A380.

A total of 251 Airbus A380s were built and delivered for civil aviation. As of May 2023, about 130 A380s are in service. Emirates leads the way with 88 active A380s. British Airways has returned its entire fleet of 12 A380s to service, Singapore is operating 10.

Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal's Airbus A380 – 502 million USD... owns an Airbus A380 with a price tag of over 500 million USD.
19/09/2023, 16:29 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: Imagine the interior of a private jet, that has a capacity of 500 passengers 🙈
19/09/2023, 16:31 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: "The 550 meter-squared aircraft has been lavishly furnished to accommodate its own concert hall, Turkish bath, garage space, and even a stable for transporting horses and camels. Not forgetting the Prince’s exquisite throne and a prayer room that rotates to face Mecca from any direction"

21/09/2023, 08:01 - Annie: 😂
21/09/2023, 08:36 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: About 200M USD
21/09/2023, 09:55 - Gareth: I mean, if I had the money
21/09/2023, 09:56 - Gareth: Critically - the private A380 was only ever an idea. It didn’t happen
21/09/2023, 10:03 - Will-hazzer777: Ahhh
21/09/2023, 10:06 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: But the article says it was made .. for that prince. .at a cost of 500M.

21/09/2023, 10:08 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: Yes. Were those just artist impressions?

21/09/2023, 10:11 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: The room would be on a 360 gyrating circular platform, i would imagine...linked to the aircrafts navigation/gps. No?
21/09/2023, 10:59 - Gareth: Exactly - would be cool to know what they did
21/09/2023, 11:50 - +44 7507 577140: My grandad had a fatwa issued against him because he mistakenly told the mosque builders that Mecca was the wrong way

21/09/2023, 20:00 - +44 7507 577140: We did have it framed somewhere
21/09/2023, 20:01 - +44 7507 577140: Or it might have banished him to hell, it was somewhere between a building violation warning and banishment to eternal damnation

27/09/2023, 08:06 - Alba: By the way could you write in spare room I’m looking for a boyfriend for sharing a nice flat instead of living with a random crowd  ?

27/09/2023, 08:07 - Alba: I knew once one guy from Spain who did that with a Latin 🔥 through an ads . They were 3 months or so.

12/10/2023, 13:43 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: _Researchers showed more than 300 videos to a sample of hiring managers. The results were unequivocal: the better the looks, the better the chances of getting hired_

They should do the inverse:
Ask all the members of "beautiful people clubs", how often have they be unemployed and compare that to a equal sized random sample of people. 
Or ... what % of attractive people go for higher education for jobs & careers?
12/10/2023, 15:00 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: Plus a new meta-analysis refutes the common wisdom that “opposites attract.” 

Did we ever really believe that anyway?  I didn't

29/10/2023, 22:46 - Oladoke: I think because they start with the assumption that it is a negative intention, hence the lies. On the other not I can see them “cancelling” it if it were to be called “black truths” 😅

31/10/2023, 13:59 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: Correct. 99.9% of us don't move around the planet all that much.
But there are 10M... who move every day. It's just the sheer number of people.

07/12/2023, 15:25 - Will-hazzer777: You don't know what her first husband looked like.
07/12/2023, 15:53 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: He looks lean...(and not so happy 😄)...probably coz he didn't have as much royal food to stuff his belly with...
07/12/2023, 15:54 - Will-hazzer777: Maybe he looked like that because he was married to Josephine.... <This message was edited>
07/12/2023, 16:03 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: ....because he wanted to _stay_ married to her... 😄
07/12/2023, 16:04 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: She didn't seem to mind short, ugly and bald(ing)... as long as they gave her a handsome divorce settlement....

Women! 🙄🤷🏻‍♂️

😄😅
07/12/2023, 23:04 - Alba: When?
07/12/2023, 23:07 - Alba: Nah I like his name . 
Nothing bad with being royal do you know the lovely weird guy who goes to Joel’s and he never worked ? 💫Privileged can read and tell stupid things too , they don’t know much about life. 
I’m wondering if Parag or Joel can invited me to one of their groups even if I can’t chat  when I will be isolated at Christmas 🐈 here or there is🏝 ..

08/12/2023, 14:42 - Will-hazzer777: Spot on 👍
08/12/2023, 14:45 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: That's precisely why I'm looking for a rich woman to marry 🧐...and get a country house to enjoy both the city and country life... 😊

08/12/2023, 14:47 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: Do you guys know if Amazon can monitor your browsing/shopping habits, and profile your income bracket, and adjust prices to match your budgets?

Good idea, isn't it? 🤓
08/12/2023, 14:48 - Will-hazzer777: https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/compare_cities.jsp?country1=United+Kingdom&city1=London&country2=Guernsey&city2=Saint+Peter+Port

@⁨Alba⁩ 

It's not what you earn that counts as such, it's the quality of life one can have and what you get to keep that matters.
08/12/2023, 14:49 - Will-hazzer777: Adjust what it shows you?
08/12/2023, 14:50 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: Yes.

So it add a bit for rich clients...and subtracts a bit for poor one...(so as not to loose poor shoppers)
08/12/2023, 15:09 - Will-hazzer777: I don't think so... It probably shows you stuff it thinks you'd like to buy but equally... It flags when something is being promoted or when it's most popular in category.
08/12/2023, 15:12 - Will-hazzer777: There's probably laws against showing different prices for the same items. But equally I'd thought that pushing certain items over others for different demographics is probably illegal too. Besides... How does Amazon know what you earn? They're all about making as much money for themselves not the seller. They'd push their own branded things or things that they are selling - we know thats the case.
08/12/2023, 15:16 - Gareth: Very hard to do
08/12/2023, 15:16 - Gareth: Starbucks sells coffee for a very wide range of prices
08/12/2023, 15:17 - Gareth: There are lots of ways to get around pricing rules
08/12/2023, 15:17 - Will-hazzer777: But they're held constant in an area like a McDonald's prices are different in different places.
08/12/2023, 15:17 - Gareth: Offers, specials, member deals, loyalty, discounts, bundles, benefits
08/12/2023, 15:17 - Will-hazzer777: They don't offer them everywhere?
08/12/2023, 15:18 - Gareth: Just examples of mechanisms
08/12/2023, 15:27 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: They can know my income bracket, from my spending habits... 
Also, (if were Amazon, and AI wiz), Amazon can jack up the prices of what i buy to see if i stop buying (an indication that i am comparing prices).
But high earners never bother. 😊
So Amazon to add 10% across all my orders (below say £50), and pocket that... i would never know.
08/12/2023, 15:30 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: ..._the corrected version__ 😅

They can know my income bracket, from my spending habits...

08/12/2023, 15:35 - Will-hazzer777: They can know your spending habit from your spending habit. They could make a bad guess at income when added to post code information too, but it'd be really off on the granular level because even rich people can be exceedingly thrifty... One of the reasons they are rich.

08/12/2023, 15:44 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: Being thrifty takes up so much bandwidth, tbh.

Is it worth it?

Once it becomes a habit (or an obsession...or OCD 😄), ...so much in life is decided based on pennies!
08/12/2023, 15:48 - Will-hazzer777: Some people are just like that... That's all they think about.
08/12/2023, 15:49 - Will-hazzer777: And lots of poor people are big spenders... They live in debt constantly.

Despite his alleged wealth he would travel to work late so he could buy off-peak tickets, only have lunch if he could find cut price sandwiches and shunned drinking in pubs for pints of milk at his desk."

08/12/2023, 16:11 - Will-hazzer777: While the poor are just not sensible.

08/12/2023, 16:14 - Annie: 👍🏽
08/12/2023, 16:17 - Will-hazzer777: Funny old world we live in.
08/12/2023, 16:18 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: Would it then be a fair expectation that people obsessed with punching pennies would never sit back and philosophise... therefore, interest in philosophy selects for non-penny pinches 😊🤷🏻‍♂️
08/12/2023, 16:22 - Will-hazzer777: I'd like to think that it selects for people who have a little bit of free time. Pinching pennies or spending more than you earn sounds time consuming whichever way you cut it.
08/12/2023, 16:25 - Annie: Or the procrastinators or dreamers or idealistic rich bustards?
08/12/2023, 16:26 - Annie: ❄️😂😂❄️

08/12/2023, 16:30 - Will-hazzer777: "a proud town mouse visits his cousin in the country. The country mouse offers the city mouse a meal of simple country cuisine, at which the visitor scoffs and invites the country mouse back to the city for a taste of the "fine life" and the two cousins dine on white bread and other fine foods. But their rich feast is interrupted by a cat which forces the rodent cousins to abandon their meal and retreat back into their mouse hole for safety. The town mouse tells the country mouse that the cat killed his mother and father and that he is frequently the target of attacks. After hearing this, the country mouse decides to return home, preferring security to opulence or, as the 13th-century preacher Odo of Cheriton phrased it, "I'd rather gnaw a bean than be gnawed by continual fear""

08/12/2023, 16:33 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: Yes,... 🤓

But specific to "our relationship with money" ... 
Philosophers, generally, aren't penny-pinchers.
😊
08/12/2023, 16:46 - Will-hazzer777: Sensible spenders in terms of outgoings and the time taken to make purchases. There needs to be a happy medium.
08/12/2023, 17:16 - Alba: Thanks lovely I’ll have a free temp apartment so maybe I’ll be ok ✅ I’ve the intuition is going to be wrong but 🤗💪🏻🏅I’m strong SEN complex complicated and I can always come back . Shops don’t open much e.g. and tomorrow I won’t have blankets , lol  🐈
08/12/2023, 17:19 - Alba: Good question , Miss, I’m lost in translation. I saw all the Tories videos to Guernsey 🇬🇬 I believe they won’t like foreigners . 
I don’t like Madrilians in Gz etc .. 
But perhaps nurses and teachers who pay taxes in UK 👩‍🏫 we will have better reputation than finance coke men avoiding taxes .
08/12/2023, 17:23 - Alba: If they’re desperate is for a reason! Annie , come with me! Or Australia 🇦🇺 👩‍🏫🌊?! Or Thailand?
Lol 💕 
They’re desperate everywhere for nice people.
Conditions are crazy 😜 
As well as changing countries .

13/12/2023, 10:14 - Ali: Maybe.. don’t overshare with people. It equals vulnerability and you don’t know who you are around if you are in a new environment. If people share things with you at the speed you go - then great. Share back. But be careful. 

Some people don’t want too much information. Whilst others can see it as a vulnerability and take advantage. <This message was edited>
13/12/2023, 10:17 - Ali: Keep yourself to yourself until others start opening up to you. It can be intense for some people x

04/01/2024, 22:42 - Alba: <Media omitted>
04/01/2024, 22:42 - Alba: Friendship is a strong 💪🏻 word in  an individualist selfish hard-working London life . 
Are we friends just to go out and discuss ?  
Do we enjoy each other companies?
Do you help your friends if you are busy? 
What’s friendship for you ? 
Sharing and caring . 
Being loyal for your friends or just to hang out ?
Someone reliable or just “superficial “friends ? 
I’ve tons of questions when I think about my home country vs. London 🏡 
Are people there more reliable ? 
Do you want friends who follow you in Social media they really like you or look after you . I’m kidding 😂
04/01/2024, 23:11 - Will-hazzer777: Unfortunately we mostly only have one word for a multitude of different relationships.

31/01/2024, 19:01 - Alba: Ridiculous I paid another holding deposit and they sent me a contract for a flat 200 more a month than I expected 😂
31/01/2024, 19:01 - Alba: I’m thinking in moving countries 🤪
31/01/2024, 19:03 - Will-hazzer777: Where to?

03/02/2024, 21:01 - Alba: I’m sad the lovely Buddha I found in Fuerteventura he seem sick with insomnia and not believing in that . Maybe he got bored of meditation and avoiding the hedonism supreme trying to achieve the nirvana 😔
03/02/2024, 21:01 - Alba: Even being a Lama is hard.

05/02/2024, 18:33 - Oladoke: What do people think about getting involved with public domestic issues? https://youtube.com/shorts/eSMfCPtKzmw?si=lMKW-iV3p7WAobvB <This message was edited>
05/02/2024, 19:13 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: It is public space.
Where possible intervention should take place, me thinks.
05/02/2024, 19:17 - Gareth: ‘Help me’ isn’t sufficient authorisation
05/02/2024, 19:18 - Gareth: Civilians lack training and experience and that includes knowing when to move outside the normal bounds of behaviour.
05/02/2024, 19:18 - Gareth: Some people are good at fighting but even that has ‘rules’ about when, where and with whom
05/02/2024, 19:19 - Gareth: If you get in trouble you need to think of some pretty creative things to yell to get people to act rather than watch.
05/02/2024, 19:19 - Gareth: Vets are pretty good at acting. Remember the octogenarian who just walked up and took the sledge hammer away from a gang member attacking a jewelry shop.
05/02/2024, 19:21 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: What does the law say ... we have a lawyer in here... 😉

Will i be prosecuted if i stood by and did nothing to prevent harm?
05/02/2024, 19:30 - Oladoke: I agree. There are also people who lose their lives trying to save others they think are under attack. I know someone whose neighbour was abusing his wife (punching) and he went to bang on the door to intervene, only for the man to pull out a gun.
05/02/2024, 19:39 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: That was inside...not public.
In such cases, you can call the police if you suspect domestic abuse.
05/02/2024, 19:39 - Gareth: Yokes. Where did that happen?
05/02/2024, 19:40 - Gareth: You’re not obliged in the UK
05/02/2024, 19:40 - Gareth: Police officers are. The test case was a PCSO. They’re not police officers and can watch you drown in a puddle without breaking the law.
05/02/2024, 19:41 - Gareth: I like to think I would help. I’ve intervened in things a couple of times
05/02/2024, 19:41 - Gareth: It can be really embarrassing as it is so far outside the ordinary
05/02/2024, 19:41 - Oladoke: but the moral behind the argument applies to both
05/02/2024, 19:41 - Oladoke: US
05/02/2024, 19:42 - Gareth: Oh yeah - forget doing anything in a country where people carry guns
05/02/2024, 19:43 - Oladoke: I tried to intervene at St Pauls (London) when a man was shoving his partner. The man flared up even more and grabbed an object heading towards me and the other few men trying to help. The woman told us not to get involved, at which point, I turned around
05/02/2024, 19:47 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: Situations where the 3rd person simply walk up and asks "is everything alright?", without active intervention...has the best outcome. 
That usually interrupts the situation.
If one of them seeks assistance then it's obviously a case of helping the person.
05/02/2024, 19:48 - Oladoke: but you still need to deal with the attacker
05/02/2024, 19:52 - Oladoke: I also notice several people say they will act but in the situation, it's not always the case
05/02/2024, 20:27 - Gareth: Yep. Hard to know until you’re there
06/02/2024, 10:36 - Jake: Basic position is no in English law. If you see a person carry out an illegal act in public, you don’t need to help out. 

Interestingly in France it’s different. You do have a general duty of care to your fellow citizens. In England that duty only arises in specific situations eg. A doctor / patient etc
10/02/2024, 21:02 - Oladoke: If you need a new years gym

14/02/2024, 19:04 - +44 7507 577140: Did my knee in on new years eve eve so all ive been able to do for the past 6 weeks is eat patatas bravas
14/02/2024, 22:34 - Alba: I miss you Bants 🐈 Yesterday I was about to go to Annie Hall Joel’s and I lost my phone credit card and holidays in Lisbon  on my way :) I came back to the London jungle ☀️ 🏝 After the Love Island Guernsey experience !

05/03/2024, 17:12 - Alba: What do you think, it's better being single or in apps reading stupid things??
05/03/2024, 21:24 - Will-hazzer777: Reading stupid things because life is about stupid things... However it's not a dichotomy... You could be out there meeting stupid people instead of reading about them. Join a club meet people more naturally if you can. <This message was edited>

Organizers in the UK moved the observance to avoid clashes with Easter school holidays and with Saint George's Day. "

16/05/2024, 21:38 - Alba: Virgos are one of the most compassionate of all and thus when they kiss it is magical. If you have never been kissed by a Virgo, you have seriously missed one of the best things of life. A Virgo can read your body language and will make sure that the kiss is everything that you have ever wanted.

06/08/2024, 12:50 - Gareth: Condemnation is easy. Taking action to address concerns, either by undermining them because they are unimportant, or by taking action on them because they are, is a core function of democracy
06/08/2024, 12:50 - Gareth: Rule by the majority, taking into account the minority
06/08/2024, 12:52 - Will-hazzer777: It's quite clear from the last election that democracy and a miriad before that it doesn't work. We're just in store for a whole load of trouble in the coming decades.
06/08/2024, 12:55 - Will-hazzer777: As we get poorer as a society.
06/08/2024, 18:06 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: I've stopped following the news. 🫥
07/08/2024, 11:25 - Will-hazzer777: Now the news follows you...
07/08/2024, 13:25 - Gareth: This!
07/08/2024, 13:25 - Gareth: Who else is saying this
07/08/2024, 13:35 - Will-hazzer777: I mean I've been banging on about it for ages but nobody likes to hear it.
07/08/2024, 14:43 - Will-hazzer777: "Jeremy Clarkson warns ‘Britain is falling apart’ as he makes Brexit U-turn

Jeremy Clarkson shared his U-turn on Brexit as the self-proclaimed Remainer fumed about the state of the UK."
 https://www.express.co.uk/celebrity-news/1931756/jeremy-clarkson-brexit-u-turn#
07/08/2024, 14:48 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: The news that follows me... 🙈 not the type i wanna know! 😬
07/08/2024, 14:55 - Gareth: Banging on about things is also sub-optimal
07/08/2024, 14:55 - Gareth: I do worry that this group of people with very strong views represent the edge of a much larger group with much more reasonable concerns
07/08/2024, 14:57 - Gareth: I wince when I hear people raging about the rioting. It's like taking things away from someone one thing at a time and then laughing at them when they eventually get very very upset about something.
07/08/2024, 14:59 - Will-hazzer777: https://youtu.be/Sj4Lx3qYRUU?si=6-R9Wo7E9WaLtMHy
07/08/2024, 15:32 - +44 7507 577140: If small scale rioting is what you want to do you have to remember that someone is going to burn something down or beat someone up or worse
07/08/2024, 15:33 - +44 7507 577140: And you will get memed and you may get locked up like the 2011 people
07/08/2024, 15:33 - +44 7507 577140: You have to decide based on these facts
07/08/2024, 15:33 - Gareth: I don't understand?

What I mean is that there will be a much larger number of people writing to their MPs, there will be more talking to their friends and then the largest group who are just unhappy and waiting for an opportunity to express that sentiment
07/08/2024, 15:34 - Gareth: All feeling the same thing and disgruntled to different degrees by the same set of problems
07/08/2024, 15:35 - Gareth: A person ought to be able to think and express concerns about cultural and ethnic integration in the UK without immediately being branded far-right.
07/08/2024, 15:35 - Gareth: I went to a play last night about a young Chinese woman's experience of discrimination and racism as a student from another country living and working in the UK. Same issue, same expression of worry about integration and fairness.
07/08/2024, 15:55 - +44 7507 577140: Think there was a play about the 2011 rioters as well actually made up of police interviews
07/08/2024, 15:55 - +44 7507 577140: What was it called?
07/08/2024, 16:17 - Gareth: Lili not Lily
07/08/2024, 16:17 - Gareth: Really good, part of the Camden Fringe
07/08/2024, 16:18 - Gareth: Do you recall the name?
07/08/2024, 16:50 - +44 7507 577140: Was called 'the riots'
09/08/2024, 15:20 - Oladoke: Fancy getting rid of that work stress? look no further than the anger retreat 😅
11/08/2024, 11:15 - Annie: Hello lovelies. 🤗
11/08/2024, 11:16 - Annie: Agreed.  
Or cultural and ethnic disintegration as well.
11/08/2024, 11:18 - Annie: But wait, unless you are William!  🤓
11/08/2024, 13:18 - Gareth: 13 years later and not much has changed in the UK in terms of addressing these issues
11/08/2024, 13:18 - Gareth: Boom!
11/08/2024, 13:19 - Gareth: For example - why not have a GOV.UK major events page - which invites bias challenge and fact checking which publishes summaries of information about major UK events?
11/08/2024, 13:19 - Gareth: A domestic version of the foreign office pages on incidents elsewhere in the world.
11/08/2024, 13:45 - Will-hazzer777: https://x.com/bristolblueeyes/status/1822552923303198770?s=46
11/08/2024, 17:21 - Annie: Classic.
11/08/2024, 19:19 - Oladoke: Exactly, that’s why it  is all out responsibilities tk ensure those far right individuals do not hijack safe spaces; they ruin it for everyone
11/08/2024, 19:21 - Gareth: How did we get to the far right again?
11/08/2024, 19:23 - Gareth: A hypothetical far right person wouldn’t make other people feel unsafe or unable to discuss right wing or even extreme right wing ideas. The person would need to hold centrist or leftist views to make those people feel unsafe / uncomfortable.

"I get knocked down, but I get up again
You are never gonna keep me down"

Release date: August 11, 1997
12/08/2024, 18:25 - Gareth: This is exactly the sort of thing I was looking for. Sorry it has taken me quite so long to sit down quietly and read it through. The illustration that this is a problem stretching across the US, India, Russia, Italy, France, Argentina, El Salvador, Israel, and Hungary was a perspective I hadn’t properly arrived at.
12/08/2024, 18:25 - Gareth: We’re looking for international causes and need national defences
12/08/2024, 18:56 - +91 80720 44735: Climate Change, hollowing out of the Middle Class, Rapidly rising Inequality, Decades of Austerity and Under investment, money in politics defeating Democracy, Housing / Health / Education / Cost of Living Crisis... take your pick!!
12/08/2024, 19:00 - Annie: The article hints at social media trends.  
This could simply be it.  
Social media does feed global trends.  
In a way the Internet has redefined democracy to encompass both sides of the political spectrum.
12/08/2024, 19:00 - Annie: That too.
12/08/2024, 19:04 - Gareth: Some of these are national - I’m tempted to say it’s perhaps the government not protecting citizens sufficiently from global influences rather than poor domestic decisions alone
12/08/2024, 20:01 - Will-hazzer777: Climate change isn't a thing.
12/08/2024, 20:13 - +91 80720 44735: Or international as well - you definitely need international cooperation to tackle Climate Change,  for example... Extend the same concept to cooperate so that Mega Corporations can't go shopping for low tax shelters and avoid paying taxes entirely... Or cooperate to restrict the ability of Russia or China to openly donate millions of Dollars in campaign contributions to buy Politicians, or Iran's ability to use Social Media Disinformation to muddy the waters before an election,  etc. <This message was edited>

19/08/2024, 05:41 - Gareth: I'm not sure we even have the tools at the moment
19/08/2024, 07:08 - +91 80720 44735: We do - it's called 'Empathy', and the framework which uses this to remind us of our Humanity is called 'Philosophy'... What more do we need?!?? 🤷‍♂😉
19/08/2024, 07:18 - Gareth: Bah.
19/08/2024, 07:19 - Gareth: Doesn’t work internationally
19/08/2024, 07:19 - +91 80720 44735: Why? Ubermensch v. Subhumans?
19/08/2024, 07:52 - Gareth: Try it. Empathise with me. I’ll see whether anything happens.
19/08/2024, 09:08 - Gareth: Holy smokes - it’s working!
19/08/2024, 09:08 - Gareth: 🤣🤣🤣
19/08/2024, 09:09 - Gareth: All I’m driving at is that problems have extended beyond the range of personal behaviour and national politics.
19/08/2024, 09:09 - Gareth: The British Government at least know about the tools for nation defence when it comes to soldiers in boats. But how do you manage cultural invasion, election tampering, misinformation campaigns.
19/08/2024, 10:30 - Will-hazzer777: Have you seen the miniscule size of our standing army... as far as I see it they don't even seem to know about soldiers in boats.... Plus the inability to stop the men of military age coming across on boats every day.
19/08/2024, 10:36 - Gareth: Let’s chat about that another time. Would welcome your thoughts about tackling internet assaults
19/08/2024, 10:36 - Gareth: For example, are the Chinese onto something with the other Great Wall?
19/08/2024, 10:37 - Will-hazzer777: Great firewall?
19/08/2024, 11:03 - +91 80720 44735: You must think that Kim Jong-Un is the greatest leader, then! 😝
19/08/2024, 11:30 - Gareth: Yep
19/08/2024, 11:30 - Gareth: How come?
19/08/2024, 11:30 - Gareth: I forget this is banter
19/08/2024, 11:30 - +91 80720 44735: His Wall is Greater?
19/08/2024, 11:31 - Gareth: My question is - should the UK consider some government-led internet censorship?
19/08/2024, 11:31 - Gareth: Should everyone
19/08/2024, 11:31 - Will-hazzer777: Each to there own really... If we want one I suppose we'll implement one. If not then there'll be significant push to have it removed.
19/08/2024, 11:31 - Gareth: We have an army
19/08/2024, 11:31 - Gareth: People try to get rid of trident all the time
19/08/2024, 11:31 - Gareth: They should
19/08/2024, 11:32 - Gareth: Some strain is part of democracy
19/08/2024, 11:32 - Will-hazzer777: Personally I think that having firewalls of various kinds, physical and digital can be a good idea.
19/08/2024, 11:32 - Will-hazzer777: I don't think the government should be allowed anywhere near it though.
19/08/2024, 11:32 - Gareth: I think something is needed and asking private companies to do it makes no sense
19/08/2024, 11:32 - Gareth: I would not let anyone else
19/08/2024, 11:33 - Gareth: Who would you give it to?
19/08/2024, 11:33 - Will-hazzer777: Perhaps a completely separate entity.... Government of digital space... I don't really get why everything power should be under a single authority.
19/08/2024, 11:35 - Gareth: A QUANGO?
19/08/2024, 11:35 - Gareth: I could go with that. Create something by charter with a specific goal and then stop the executive playing with it too much
19/08/2024, 11:35 - Will-hazzer777: Like that but with elected MPs and a prime minister who knows what they're talking about.
19/08/2024, 11:36 - Will-hazzer777: MP for Facebook... MP for X...
19/08/2024, 11:36 - Will-hazzer777: MP for Spotify.
19/08/2024, 11:36 - Gareth: No
19/08/2024, 11:36 - Gareth: It's too big and would cost a fortune
19/08/2024, 11:37 - Will-hazzer777: I think it could be done quite cheaply tbh.
19/08/2024, 11:37 - Will-hazzer777: There'd be no non-digital infrastructure needed.
19/08/2024, 11:38 - Will-hazzer777: They'd not need second homes, they'd not need cars and expenses. They'd not need to turn up in person to a physical house of commons.
19/08/2024, 11:49 - Gareth: How then are they linked in or accountable?
19/08/2024, 11:50 - Will-hazzer777: Isn't it a case of when to implement a firewall or not.
19/08/2024, 11:52 - Will-hazzer777: What kind of material should be allowed or not allowed to be viewed and I think it's obvious that material on one platform might need policing while on another it doesn't. That's for the MP or minister for that platform to implement or not as the case maybe. If they get the call wrong... They can be removed from their position by democratic means.
19/08/2024, 11:53 - Will-hazzer777: A coordinated approach across all platforms isn't necessary or needed. Besides it'd be too unwieldy to implement.
19/08/2024, 12:09 - Gareth: I think a case can be built for:
a) International tax treaties which manage revenue from companies rather than the other way around
b) Detection of private and state interference with public information
c) Official information (What's to stop the UK running an information service for example)
19/08/2024, 12:31 - Will-hazzer777: I mean there's always interference from private people and organisations and other states... That's not going to change. A minister with executive powers for particular realms of the internet can't be held to account for things outside their control.

What they can be held accountable for is how they implement censorship or freedom of expression on such platforms, whether from private individuals inside the realm or outside the realm... 

Similarly it's a stupid idea to think we can police the world and what they do on the internet e.g. trying to extradite the likes of Elon Musk... What a minister for digital platforms with executive powers can do is censor or not as the case maybe depending on what they believe to be in the public interest or not. That's really all that can and should be done with the policing of the internet.

What people are allowed to do in physical space is up to the government of the land... What people can see or not in cyberspace should be up to a completely different entity.

I don't think what people get up to in cyberspace should be policed by the government of the land unless it pertains to something they've done in physical space... 

If it doesn't pertain to something they've done in physical space, people shouldn't be for example jailed for a tweet or a post.

Their comments could be censored by a separate entity to the government of the physical realm i.e. a government of cyberspace, but their should be no physical ramifications to their purely online musings.
19/08/2024, 12:46 - Gareth: There was a great deal less in the past. There was a time in history when you needed to send agents to other countries to try to influence them. Now you can open an account on Instagram
19/08/2024, 12:47 - Gareth: I don't think it's crazy to think it possible for there to be some international cooperation
19/08/2024, 12:47 - Gareth: What I do virtually I do from the UK and that feels like a sensible start for jurisdiction
19/08/2024, 13:13 - Will-hazzer777: The same applies forward as it does backwards.
19/08/2024, 13:14 - Gareth: Yes. So now would be a good time to set up some sensible bodies, powers, and measures
19/08/2024, 13:15 - Will-hazzer777: I think it's crazy to think that there can be international cooperation on most topics. There's hardly any agreement even with countries, especially ones that are increasingly less homogeneous.
19/08/2024, 13:16 - Gareth: There's a surprising amount of it if you look through a more positive lens. Shipping is almost completely standardised. Internet protocols are almost completely standardised. International banking is almost completely standardised.
19/08/2024, 13:16 - Gareth: I appreciate the controversial stuff is more visible. After all, agreement is invisible because everyone agress
19/08/2024, 13:17 - Gareth: What's is needed is someone to recognise that the benefits will be asymmetric. Countries set up tax havens because they need inward cash flow. They need to be given that as part of any deal.
19/08/2024, 13:17 - Will-hazzer777: Where there are win-win financial incentives, there'll be cooperation. Where there's any other combination there'll be no cooperation, just pure dominance by big players.
19/08/2024, 13:18 - Gareth: This happened a lot with the EU. The major states could see the minor states would need advantages and flexibility they didn't
19/08/2024, 13:18 - Gareth: The EU is an example of where this isn't the case.
19/08/2024, 13:18 - Gareth: There's plenty of win-lose
19/08/2024, 13:18 - Gareth: So I would add 'Shared interest'
19/08/2024, 13:18 - Gareth: As another consideration or factor
19/08/2024, 13:19 - Gareth: If you can make it, nations against multinationals then nations are on the same side by default
19/08/2024, 13:19 - Will-hazzer777: Where there's win-win situations then clearly there cooperation... But increasingly we'll see as the money dries up things will start fragmenting faster.
19/08/2024, 13:19 - Gareth: Sure. And where is the money Will?
19/08/2024, 13:19 - Gareth: What's absurd is that the long term best way to have more money is to support the little guy today
19/08/2024, 13:20 - Gareth: a la China
19/08/2024, 13:20 - Gareth: While everyone has been getting poorer in the UK, they created a colossal middle class
19/08/2024, 13:21 - Gareth: I think companies should pay for the natural resources they use
19/08/2024, 13:22 - Gareth: For example - that could be implemented globally
19/08/2024, 13:24 - Will-hazzer777: Currently nation-states are being enticed to do things they wouldn't otherwise with their own money. 

As we get poorer as nations, especially in the west, there'll be less and less of our own money to coax us with and the elites who currently are using carrot and stick tactics (more carrot than stick until recently) to keep a lid on various disagreements won't be able to control the unravelling.
19/08/2024, 13:25 - Gareth: So... we should do something about it?
19/08/2024, 13:26 - Gareth: I mean, last time around people knocked on their doors and introduced the to their guillotines. I'd like to think we can avoid that this time around.
19/08/2024, 13:27 - Will-hazzer777: I don't think we can tbh.
19/08/2024, 13:28 - Will-hazzer777: Can't do anything about it... Just need to get your own house in order to not get caught up once the deluge arrives.
19/08/2024, 13:28 - Gareth: This is why variation in people is a good thing. You worry about stuff and people like me listen. But then we think we can try to do something about it. You get to either be happy and wrong, or right and, well, unhappy.
19/08/2024, 13:28 - Gareth: I'm not sure that's possible.
19/08/2024, 13:28 - Will-hazzer777: It's starting to metaphorically pour quite heavily as we speak...
19/08/2024, 13:29 - Gareth: Yes, and rather than check your roof, I think we should be looking at social scale. Proper culverts etc
19/08/2024, 13:30 - Will-hazzer777: Umm everyone in the west thinks that human nature changed after 1945 for some reason...
19/08/2024, 13:36 - Gareth: Poor government and hope
19/08/2024, 13:37 - Gareth: You can't avoid that sort of thing. It just comes to your door
19/08/2024, 13:38 - Will-hazzer777: The hope that human nature changed some how...? How is that hope? That's where blank slate thinking gets you... Up shit creek without a paddle.
19/08/2024, 13:42 - Will-hazzer777: Not to my door it isn't. To the overtly bourgeoisie highly likely... To the bankers, lawyers and MPs maybe.

The number of MPs who have been murdered or almost murdered in the last few years is unprecedented and I predict that unfortunately their numbers will likely be added to in the next decade.
19/08/2024, 13:42 - Will-hazzer777: All part and parcel though... All part and parcel...
19/08/2024, 13:46 - Gareth: No, hope is what leads to people thinking we are different creatures
19/08/2024, 13:46 - Gareth: Israel / Gaza should illustrate what people will do when they think they can
19/08/2024, 13:47 - Gareth: What was the last one? HQ in school bombed.

What happened to not bombing schools? When did putting a military HQ in one ever justify bombing it? Morals are flexible.
19/08/2024, 13:50 - Will-hazzer777: Human nature has to be worked with not assumed that it can be changed. Supposed 'hope' leads people to make naive and unfounded assumptions about their fellow human beings that are patiently false and ideologically driven. <This message was edited>
19/08/2024, 13:51 - Gareth: Yep
19/08/2024, 13:51 - Gareth: Happens all the time
19/08/2024, 13:52 - Will-hazzer777: Also they love death more than they believe the Israelis love life...
19/08/2024, 13:53 - Gareth: The whole thing is really very uncomfortable
19/08/2024, 13:54 - Will-hazzer777: "In 2007, two years before he killed thirteen people and wounded twenty-nine at Fort Hood, Texas, Nidal Malik Hasan prepared a slide show
for his fellow Army doctors on the subject of Islam. One of his last points read: “We love death more than you love life!”

These grisly words are as foreign to Western sensibilities as they are all but sacred dogma for Muslim radicals at war with the West—and with Western sensibilities.

The sentence originated with a 7th-century Muslim commander who threatened his enemies with the prospect of “an army of men that love death as you love life.”"
 https://nationalpost.com/holy-post/we-love-death-more-than-you-love-life#
19/08/2024, 13:56 - Will-hazzer777: To a post-christian westerner yes... It's an alien concept, but shows that different human beings have different natures and their adopted ideologies only serve to highlight those differences.
19/08/2024, 13:58 - Will-hazzer777: The ideology of the blank slate itself is a post-christian western conception i.e. because Christianity taught that anyone can be saved and brought into the fold, clearly our natures are not fixed but completely mailable. This is patently false.
19/08/2024, 14:01 - Will-hazzer777: This is why western societies spend vast amounts on reformation and rehabilitation of criminals, whilst other societies realised some time ago that enforced rehabilitation is a pointless exercise.
19/08/2024, 14:02 - Will-hazzer777: It is also contrary to biblical teaching.
21/08/2024, 18:21 - Gareth: What's the follow up here? I mean I hope he was incarcerated when they realised how much worse what was really happening was

17/10/2024, 17:14 - Gareth: Is it just me or is listening to the government debate how to tax us just about the most depressing political situation imaginable

Everything else sounds depressing 🙄
17/10/2024, 17:41 - Alba: I want to teach abroad for the winter again.

17/10/2024, 18:51 - Will-hazzer777: Well, they have to consider it very carefully. We'll have to see if the primary reason they want to tax us more is to fill the coffers or tax is in order to spite us.

They may well miscalculate in order to achieve the first reason because the second reason might be too strong a personal motivation.
