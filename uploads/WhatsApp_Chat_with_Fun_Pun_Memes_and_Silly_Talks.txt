15/02/2024, 14:53 - Gareth: I saw this earlier today
15/02/2024, 14:54 - Gareth: Social Media is a wild place eh?
15/02/2024, 14:55 - onur: I saw similar types of reactions IRL so im not sure its on social media
15/02/2024, 14:55 - onur: 🤣
15/02/2024, 14:55 - Gareth: You cried or heard a story from someone else?
15/02/2024, 14:58 - +44 7599 430972: Testosterone injections
15/02/2024, 15:00 - +44 7452 968792: I’m more concerned about him not letting her she him cry in the 3 years…
15/02/2024, 15:01 - +44 7452 968792: He’s afraid of vulnerability and they’ve been together for 3 years?
15/02/2024, 15:01 - onur: I have been called a weak man like 2-3 times, and I also cried once and I think it changes how the person sees you :D
15/02/2024, 15:01 - Gareth: Lame eh?
15/02/2024, 15:02 - Gareth: You’re not weak?
15/02/2024, 15:02 - +44 7599 430972: It depends solely on the bench press
15/02/2024, 15:02 - onur: given that they are a christian couple im sure they arent talking much
15/02/2024, 15:02 - +44 7452 968792: Wtf 😬 and then people are surprised why men have the highest rates of suicide
15/02/2024, 15:02 - Gareth: What sort of twit thinks crying is a sign of weakness?
15/02/2024, 15:03 - onur: i have weaknesses and strengths like everybody else and that's ok :D
15/02/2024, 15:03 - +44 7599 430972: Highest is a weird predicate when used to compare 2 things
15/02/2024, 15:03 - +44 7958 612614: you were not crying!  it was the rain ...
15/02/2024, 15:03 - Gareth: I do think there’s something about giving up the image of competence and capability if that’s what you have built a relationship on. You can’t follow that course and change your mind part way through.
15/02/2024, 15:03 - Gareth: Best? Most awesome?
15/02/2024, 15:04 - Gareth: Superior! That’s the one
15/02/2024, 15:04 - Gareth: Exactly. Me too.
15/02/2024, 15:05 - +44 7599 430972: In the context I would assume the meaning was "bigger than women" if we assume two groups
15/02/2024, 15:05 - +44 7452 968792: I always encourage men to show their emotions, you never know when they need it most
15/02/2024, 15:05 - +44 7599 430972: If non-binary people are included then men are not the highest <This message was edited>
15/02/2024, 15:05 - +44 7958 612614: are you a therapist?
15/02/2024, 15:05 - +44 7599 430972: What if that emotion is disgust?
15/02/2024, 15:05 - +44 7452 968792: No but I can easily be one, I know too much
15/02/2024, 15:06 - +44 7958 612614: tell me about knowing too much. it feels like a curse
15/02/2024, 15:06 - +44 7452 968792: (Don’t use this as an excuse to get free therapy from me) 😂
15/02/2024, 15:07 - +44 7452 968792: Read a lot of psychology, studied psychology, be around people who know this topic well
15/02/2024, 15:07 - onur: apes are disgusted by wet stuff
15/02/2024, 15:08 - onur: its funny to see chimps runny away from rain
15/02/2024, 15:08 - +44 7958 612614: if i were looking for a therapist - i'd pick someone properly screwed up - like @⁨onur⁩  or @⁨~Alex S⁩  - chatting to them would make me realise how lucky i am
15/02/2024, 15:09 - onur: 🥴
15/02/2024, 15:09 - +44 7599 430972: Funny that I moved to UK with the exact same reasoning
15/02/2024, 15:09 - onur: im offerin sessions guys 20£ an hour
15/02/2024, 15:10 - +44 7958 612614: erotic massage?
15/02/2024, 15:10 - onur: counceling, massage, quick handjob <This message was edited>
15/02/2024, 15:10 - onur: whatever u want baby
15/02/2024, 15:10 - Will-hazzer777: If you're a heterosexual man I've heard from a number of different male sources that you shouldn't show emotional weakness to your significant other especially if they're the type of person who is with you because you're 'the strong one'.
15/02/2024, 15:10 - +44 7452 968792: I’d like to see how well you do with therapy
15/02/2024, 15:11 - +44 7599 430972: It was interesting watching you figuring out the spelling of massage
15/02/2024, 15:11 - onur: yeah those types are mostly feminists btw
15/02/2024, 15:11 - onur: love them
15/02/2024, 15:11 - +44 7958 612614: shout out to @⁨onur⁩  - the service always above and beyond the call of duty
15/02/2024, 15:12 - +44 7958 612614: are you the source, by any  chance?
15/02/2024, 15:12 - onur: me receiving it or giving it? 😅 both would be cool because im good at asking questions
15/02/2024, 15:12 - +44 7958 612614: yes, stupid questions
15/02/2024, 15:12 - +44 7958 612614: sorry, just joking 🤣
15/02/2024, 15:14 - Will-hazzer777: No a 46 year old male friend of mine and a YouTuber...I'm sure there's been others but I can't think.of who they are at the minute.
15/02/2024, 15:14 - +44 7599 430972: A youtuber sounds like an insult....
15/02/2024, 15:14 - +44 7958 612614: ok, but include it in the footnotes please, once the white paper is out
15/02/2024, 15:15 - onur: why
15/02/2024, 15:15 - +44 7599 430972: Idk, perhaps something in the line of attention seeking
15/02/2024, 15:16 - +44 7958 612614: I just read this book about psychopaths - they tend to overanalyse everything and find it interest.  Just sayin’… 😵‍💫
15/02/2024, 15:16 - +44 7599 430972: Never said I ain't one
15/02/2024, 15:16 - +44 7452 968792: Giving it
15/02/2024, 15:16 - onur: is seeking attention bad
15/02/2024, 15:17 - +44 7452 968792: Psychopathy is a whole topic in itself
15/02/2024, 15:17 - +44 7958 612614: You’re so vain, you probably think my post is about you … 🎼🎶🎶.  By the way - grandiosity is one of the signs as well…
15/02/2024, 15:17 - +44 7452 968792: Was it ‘surrounded by psychopaths’ by any reson?
15/02/2024, 15:17 - +44 7599 430972: Like many things it depends on a context
15/02/2024, 15:17 - +44 7599 430972: If you are stranded on the raft in the ocean - no
15/02/2024, 15:17 - +44 7452 968792: That’s narcissism.. which is also a sign of psychopathy
15/02/2024, 15:18 - +44 7599 430972: If you are having an identity crisis - yes

15/02/2024, 15:20 - +44 7452 968792: That’s also similar to sociopathy
15/02/2024, 15:20 - +44 7958 612614: Like, the lack of realistic long-term goals is for example if someone wanted to become a YouTuber
15/02/2024, 15:20 - +44 7958 612614: 2 identical things - sociopathy just means you were not born with it - but the distinction is at best quesitonable
15/02/2024, 15:21 - +44 7958 612614: BTW - I think this list a bullshit, but anyway
15/02/2024, 15:21 - +44 7452 968792: <Media omitted>
15/02/2024, 15:23 - +44 7958 612614: LOL, where did you find this one?  I don’t think it’s correct
15/02/2024, 15:23 - +44 7599 430972: The "tend to be successful" part always made me laugh
15/02/2024, 15:23 - +44 7599 430972: Is it a psychopath's sales pitch?
15/02/2024, 15:23 - Will-hazzer777: "I ask this because many guys have said that despite women saying they wouldn't mind if they cried, they've found that women didn't take them as seriously afterward. They say that women view them as weaker."

15/02/2024, 15:24 - +44 7599 430972: But I wanted to be one!!!
15/02/2024, 15:24 - +44 7452 968792: Most of them are successful tho. Just look at Putin
15/02/2024, 15:24 - onur: wtf
15/02/2024, 15:24 - +44 7599 430972: It's like looking in a mirror isn't it
15/02/2024, 15:25 - +44 7958 612614: go to the back of the queue please - no tantrums
15/02/2024, 15:25 - onur: but these are not psychopathy traits
15/02/2024, 15:25 - +44 7958 612614: If anything - psychopaths are ranked as more dangerous - https://www.medicinenet.com/which_one_is_worse_sociopath_or_psychopath/article.htm
15/02/2024, 15:25 - +44 7452 968792: Crying can be seen as a psychopathic trait if it’s used as manipulation
15/02/2024, 15:25 - Will-hazzer777: <Media omitted>
15/02/2024, 15:26 - +44 7958 612614: They have no emotions like that - they are very good at reading what the right response is (copying behaviour)
15/02/2024, 15:26 - +44 7452 968792: Like not genuine crying, like crocodile tears used to manipulate
15/02/2024, 15:30 - +44 7958 612614: they don’t have proper amygdalae response - fight or flight.  so one experiment was they took a control group and psychopaths and attached them to EEG or whatever and told them that within 10 seconds they’d received a strong electro shock.  The normal people started sweating showing the signs of distress - the psychopaths - nothing.  They only flinched when the shock was administreed.  The ssecon shock, straight  afterwards - agaijn 10 seconds warning - the normal people even more stresed out and showing anxiety and sweating - psychopaths nothing
15/02/2024, 15:30 - +44 7958 612614: I think they were still human tears, but not genuine 😵‍💫
15/02/2024, 15:31 - +44 7958 612614: No empathy and no fear - they don’t get distressed when witnessing something horrible - for them it’s only someething interesting to analyse.
15/02/2024, 15:31 - +44 7958 612614: Most of them pay extra attention how they dress kup - which is intereesting
15/02/2024, 15:31 - +44 7894 560223: NGL that sounds great, I want it
15/02/2024, 15:32 - +44 7894 560223: Not the shocks, the lack of response
15/02/2024, 15:32 - +44 7958 612614: stand in teh queue, please
15/02/2024, 15:32 - +44 7894 560223: I want therapy so I can become a psychopath
15/02/2024, 15:32 - +44 7958 612614: that’s a major reason why they are so successful.  They don’t analyse long term drawbacks of failure of their plan - they focus on teh successful execution instead
15/02/2024, 15:32 - +44 7958 612614: Not cheap… not cheap
15/02/2024, 15:33 - +44 7452 968792: If you’re interested in psychopaths. I recommend watching the documentary with piers Morgan. He interviews a killer and just the way he talks about the murder is enough to send shivers down your spine.
15/02/2024, 15:33 - +44 7958 612614: Hmmm, I’d say - yes, sure, but CANNOT STAND that slimy c****
15/02/2024, 15:34 - +44 7452 968792: https://youtu.be/_ptbnHDrkKs?si=grz17KDQkhpKYGrs
15/02/2024, 15:34 - +44 7958 612614: @⁨Will-hazzer777⁩  - sorry, I’m sure he’s great - it’s just me….
15/02/2024, 15:34 - +353 89 605 0161: Sounds like a kind of boring life.
Maybe when you're a psychopath you don't know what you're missing.

Do they have a similar lack of response to expectations of positive experience?
15/02/2024, 15:35 - +44 7958 612614: They are always bored and look for engagement and excitement.  They always tend to live in big cities and they don’t mind researchers “woking” on them because it’s a chance for learning something new and a chance to manipulate
15/02/2024, 15:35 - Will-hazzer777: Please don't compare me to Piers Morgan...
15/02/2024, 15:36 - +44 7958 612614: No, I thought he’s one of the tools in your toolbox
15/02/2024, 15:36 - Will-hazzer777: I can agree that he's a TOOL but he's not in my 'toolbox'...
15/02/2024, 15:37 - +353 89 605 0161: Doesn't sound a million miles away from depression in some ways
15/02/2024, 15:37 - +44 7958 612614: hmm, I don’t think that’s correct…
15/02/2024, 15:37 - +44 7894 560223: Ill take it over actual fear, anxiety and depression
15/02/2024, 15:37 - +44 7958 612614: They are not depressed - they are always engaged in plans - and they get huge satisfaction out of dominating, superiority, analysing
15/02/2024, 15:37 - +353 89 605 0161: In so much as having a reduced response to emotionally provocative stimulus <This message was edited>
15/02/2024, 15:38 - +44 7958 612614: I’ll look into that. -but they are really really strongly motivated - but all of the motivations are about self affirmation
15/02/2024, 15:38 - +353 89 605 0161: Yeah, the engagement and actively working towards things is totally differebt
15/02/2024, 15:40 - +44 7958 612614: They have no empathy, but I’d call this dubious - most of them have a strong meritocratic values - like - they desppise the whingers (sorry @⁨onur⁩ ) - they like strong people who fight and win despite circumstances.  Trump is literally the epitome of that type.  I
15/02/2024, 15:40 - +44 7894 560223: What's the downside
15/02/2024, 15:40 - +44 7894 560223: It's too good to be true
15/02/2024, 15:40 - +44 7452 968792: They hurt others
15/02/2024, 15:41 - +353 89 605 0161: But are they incapable of these feelings or are they triggered by different experiences than "normal"? <This message was edited>
15/02/2024, 15:41 - +44 7599 430972: Sounds like others problem
15/02/2024, 15:41 - +44 7894 560223: Maybe the real psycho is the one conducting the experiment
15/02/2024, 15:42 - +44 7958 612614: They are manipulative and they get intro trouble repeatedly because for them that’s not unpleasant.  They don’t have normal emotional connection with people - it’s either master slave or nothing
15/02/2024, 15:42 - +44 7958 612614: It’s impossible to conduct experiments like that anymore
15/02/2024, 15:43 - onur: i didnt even understand what u said so u cool
15/02/2024, 15:43 - +44 7452 968792: The problem is that they are very charming, so if you are not aware you can easily fall for their charms
15/02/2024, 15:44 - +44 7599 430972: Just like you fall for charms of religious and political movements?
15/02/2024, 15:44 - +44 7452 968792: They know how to get what they want
15/02/2024, 15:44 - +44 7452 968792: Yes, cult leaders, politicians most likely psychopath’s
15/02/2024, 15:45 - +44 7452 968792: CEOs
15/02/2024, 15:45 - +44 7894 560223: My body chose the wrong career path it seems like
15/02/2024, 15:46 - +44 7599 430972: Kark Marx was a psychopath 😱
15/02/2024, 15:46 - +353 89 605 0161: Do they?
Seems like a bit of a selection bias sometimes with these studies.

Positions of power like cult leader, politician etc... Will attract _successful_ psychopaths.
But that doesn't mean there aren't plenty of unsuccessful psychopaths <This message was edited>
15/02/2024, 15:48 - +44 7452 968792: I’m sure there are unsuccessful psychopaths out there but with their charms they can easily win people over and therefore making it more likely that they will reach success
15/02/2024, 15:48 - +44 7599 430972: Ngl sounds like superpower to me

15/02/2024, 15:50 - +44 7958 612614: yep, that’s universally true.  They also come across as being very logical and “reasonable” and the more you know them - the more you like them because they keep on telling you what you want to hear
15/02/2024, 15:50 - +44 7958 612614: That’s, like, the worst mistake.  Good luck!
15/02/2024, 15:51 - +44 7958 612614: They recover very quickly because bad experiences don’t result in a trauma
15/02/2024, 15:51 - +44 7599 430972: Definitely Karl Marx
15/02/2024, 15:51 - +353 89 605 0161: Well that's the bit I'm not sure holds up.
"With their charms"
The successful ones need charm to become successful so it would appear psychopaths are charming.
But none of the symptoms of psychopathy seem to suggest more charm.
So the unsuccessful psychopaths _aren't_ charming.

So being charming isn't necessarily a psychopathic trait. <This message was edited>
15/02/2024, 15:53 - +44 7958 612614: Alex, it’s totally logical - they are extremely good at reading people - so they know how to appeal to them.  Then they use it for manipulation.  I believe that pretty much all of them are charming (meaning you find something unusual that you like).  I’ve watched like probably close to a hundred of interviews - they are all extremely engaging and interesting
15/02/2024, 15:54 - +44 7452 968792: Charm isn’t exclusively for psychopaths. sociopaths and narcissists also are charming but that’s one thing they use to manipulate. It’s all a game to them
15/02/2024, 15:55 - +44 7958 612614: But the really interesting aspect is this propensity to dress up super impressively - so they totally stand out (to me as potential psychopaths) - to others are someones you admire for dressing up like that….  They simply can’t control some of their behavioural traits
15/02/2024, 15:55 - +44 7958 612614: I believe that all the psychopaths are narcissists

15/02/2024, 16:04 - +353 89 605 0161: Feels incomplete. Basing traits on the psychopaths who've reached highly successful positions or ended up in prison.

Are those the only destinations for psychopaths. How many have just ended up in shit jobs. Or the head of a home owners association...

I am trying to Google something that looks like it's more than just a collection of anecdotes but I'm getting a lot of pop psychology rubbish.
15/02/2024, 16:06 - +44 7599 430972: The rise of psychopathy in pop-psy was coincidentally after twilight release
15/02/2024, 16:06 - +44 7599 430972: correlation vs causation?
15/02/2024, 16:08 - +44 7958 612614: their lack of fear of failure and high focus and single mindedness makes them very successful for better or worse
15/02/2024, 16:11 - +44 7452 968792: Let’s all blame it on the sparkly vampire 😂 but probably Edward is one too. Bella just couldn’t resist his charms
15/02/2024, 16:12 - +353 89 605 0161: Breaking into a young woman's house and watching her sleep is v romantic. Don't let anyone tell you different 👍

May be in an adult partnership, one partner expects the other to be (always) stronger. If the roles reverse (even briefly), the expectations of future co-dependency could come under question. 🤷🏻‍♂️

15/02/2024, 16:53 - +44 7452 968792: Why not? Every psychopath exhibits grandiose tendencies, hence the charm and attention. But narcissistic personality disorder is a separate condition, not every narcissist is a murderer lol
15/02/2024, 16:53 - onur: narcissism is being insecure with your weaknesses, so idk if a psychopath would be able to feel this insecurity
15/02/2024, 16:54 - onur: not all grandoise behaviour is narcissism

15/02/2024, 16:56 - +44 7452 968792: The narcissist feels insecure but acts confident, whereas the sociopath and psychopath feel confident. It’s not a matter of insecurity for them
15/02/2024, 16:57 - onur: yes

I was so unprepared...

Uh so if there's anything I can tell the young people watching this...don't Reveal Your inner vulnerabilities and your feelings to your romantic partner unless you want it to end immediately... I can tell you the the comments of men who said "and I watched the love like disappear from her eyes"... all right so that's your advice for the day do not reveal your feelings if you're a man....

Keeping yourself all hidden away is not the answer to this issue at all.
Finding someone else, or working on your issues is.
15/02/2024, 18:00 - Will-hazzer777: Yeah work on your issues... Sounds like a good strategy...
15/02/2024, 18:01 - +44 7599 430972: How about extracting all your weaknesses into a subpersona and then depersonalising from it?
15/02/2024, 18:01 - +44 7599 430972: Or gaslight your partner

15/02/2024, 18:05 - +353 89 605 0161: Plus, there's no context for these displays of emotion.
"I cried in front of my partner and they lost interest."
What were you crying over?
Was it something ridiculous? Fair enough to your partner then.
15/02/2024, 18:06 - +44 7599 430972: What if it was a manly reason to cry, like, let’s say, fall of the roman empire?
15/02/2024, 18:07 - +353 89 605 0161: Then your partner is a heartless monster and life has done you a favour removing them from your life 👍
15/02/2024, 18:07 - +353 89 605 0161: Ancient Romans loved a good cry too
15/02/2024, 18:08 - +44 7452 968792: If you being vulnerable is what it takes to make them lose interest then you’ve won, because why would you want someone like that in your life?
15/02/2024, 18:10 - +44 7599 430972: I doubt that people actually desire to have other people in their lives, it’s a necessity at best

15/02/2024, 18:15 - +44 7958 612614: HOld on, there’s a practical aspect to this.  What if you cried so frequently that your partner had to give you tissues - and consequently didn’t have any for their own use?

That is a heavy burden to carry and it is no surprise most men would rather die than cry in front of other human beings."

15/02/2024, 23:17 - +44 7599 430972: And when unlimited days off were introduced?
15/02/2024, 23:17 - Parag-meetup: I guess 1682 ?
15/02/2024, 23:17 - +44 7599 430972: Good job
15/02/2024, 23:17 - Parag-meetup: No 1686
15/02/2024, 23:18 - +44 7599 430972: Go tell that to someone else
15/02/2024, 23:18 - Parag-meetup: Ok 1688
15/02/2024, 23:19 - Parag-meetup: So it’s moving in the wrong direction ?
15/02/2024, 23:19 - Parag-meetup: May be the graph is upside down
15/02/2024, 23:29 - Parag-meetup: This is on top of the 4 weeks which they get legally

16/02/2024, 08:47 - +353 89 605 0161: V similar to what he said about paternity leave.
You offer optional benefit and no one wants to be the one to take it.
As of 2022 it's only 6% of companies offering it, and everyone knows its bs.
16/02/2024, 08:53 - +44 7599 430972: What if men just love working so much they want to be the one still in workforce
16/02/2024, 08:58 - +353 89 605 0161: It was compulsory "for a couple of years", but after that they didn't go back.
So Swedish men, at least, don't seem to feel that way.
16/02/2024, 08:59 - +44 7599 430972: Swedish government *
16/02/2024, 08:59 - +44 7599 430972: Although I can see them doing that
16/02/2024, 09:00 - +353 89 605 0161: No, after the mandate is lifted the men still take pat leave
16/02/2024, 09:00 - +44 7599 430972: Ah I read it wrong
16/02/2024, 09:02 - +44 7599 430972: USSR had 3 years of maternity leave at one point, in my opinion it depends mostly on budget and unemployment metrics. However, given Sweden deindustrialised I can see that there is no benefit to keep men in workforce
16/02/2024, 09:05 - +44 7599 430972: Yeah, sweden is high on unemployment so I think the churn is low
16/02/2024, 11:47 - Parag-meetup: Or if you increase their efficiency , you get more out of them
16/02/2024, 11:47 - Parag-meetup: So did you eat your own there ?

18/02/2024, 09:28 - +353 89 605 0161: Pretty tame complaining.
Barely a complaint tbh, more just a statement.
18/02/2024, 09:32 - onur: https://www.instagram.com/reel/C2qJVadyG7U/?igsh=MXhhc3h1eDU2Ymp6dQ==
18/02/2024, 09:32 - onur: lolllll
18/02/2024, 09:32 - +44 7599 430972: I think the issue is not how much complaining there is, but to there are people that move to the culture expecting less of that
18/02/2024, 09:33 - +44 7599 430972: Like moving to UK and wishing there would be less British culture in my life
18/02/2024, 09:33 - +44 7599 430972: Which is emotionally valid, logically not
18/02/2024, 09:35 - Will-hazzer777: I think they cut the bit where she bursts into tears at the end...
18/02/2024, 09:35 - +44 7599 430972: I can understand, I would also cry if I were in Finland
18/02/2024, 09:35 - onur: why? bcuz of all horrible finns?
18/02/2024, 09:36 - onur: and also the turban is preventing her blend in
18/02/2024, 09:36 - Will-hazzer777: She is probably a Finnish convert...
18/02/2024, 09:37 - onur: she wants to live like a desert person, speak and look like a desert person, maybe she doesnt belong to finland
18/02/2024, 09:37 - +44 7599 430972: There is always be a group of people incapable of assimilating - look at Brighton Beach in US - it looks like mix of pre-soviet Russia and 90s
18/02/2024, 09:37 - +353 89 605 0161: For sure, that is fair enough for people trying to "protect" their culture to be concerned about. 
This video, I don't think, showed someone of that mindset.

"it's hard to fit in because there's a lack of diversity" that's just a legitimate and barely loaded statement.

And Finland doesn't have much of a cultural export so fair enough to have no idea what you're walking into 🤷‍♂
18/02/2024, 09:37 - +44 7599 430972: An interesting point is that migrants usually “freeze” in a time period they fled
18/02/2024, 09:37 - onur: 🥲
18/02/2024, 09:39 - +44 7599 430972: Not protection. It’s just finland is such a remote and, as you mentioned, “unknown” country that it makes people question why is that your first choice to move there and not, let’s say, faroe islands
18/02/2024, 09:39 - Will-hazzer777: https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/29/refugees-refusing-leave-bus-too-cold-sweden-removed
18/02/2024, 09:40 - +44 7599 430972: Yeah, hong kong and singapore are mow much more progressive than people that left it 20-30 years ago
18/02/2024, 09:40 - Will-hazzer777: Benefits
18/02/2024, 09:41 - +44 7599 430972: Well I am against all sorts of benefits so those fins had it coming
18/02/2024, 09:41 - +44 7599 430972: They are also the closest to “european type” socialism
18/02/2024, 09:42 - Will-hazzer777: The benefit system for any country only continues when there's social cohesion... That's why most are collapsing.
18/02/2024, 09:43 - +44 7599 430972: Nah I think people should have some sort of insurance, but insurance and benefits are very different
18/02/2024, 09:44 - Will-hazzer777: If you can't pay for your own insurance, the state will pay for yours... Therefore its a benefit.
18/02/2024, 09:44 - +44 7599 430972: But if you come into a country for free money I think you can handle some fins
18/02/2024, 09:44 - +44 7599 430972: At least from my perspective
18/02/2024, 09:44 - +44 7599 430972: I could tolerate a lot of things for free money
18/02/2024, 09:44 - Will-hazzer777: Benefits or work... Or study or anything...
18/02/2024, 09:45 - +44 7599 430972: Well the point is accountability and what risk are you willing to take. You can insure your income protection but you can opt-out if you are sure you will never need it
18/02/2024, 09:45 - onur: these refugees are handed out privileges
18/02/2024, 09:45 - onur: its frustrating for me
18/02/2024, 09:46 - +44 7599 430972: I think not allowing people to make mistakes makes this mistakes more likely to happen
18/02/2024, 09:47 - +44 7599 430972: Well those are for fins to figure out
18/02/2024, 09:47 - +44 7599 430972: It’s their money they can give them to whoever they want
18/02/2024, 09:47 - Will-hazzer777: It can't last forever... The social welfare systems will collapse under it's own weight... Just need to hit the threshold of more people taking out than putting in... Currently the official figures in the UK are 1/3 people... So over half isn't far away...
18/02/2024, 09:48 - +44 7599 430972: It’s a problem of any public system
18/02/2024, 09:48 - +44 7599 430972: It only grows before collapsing
18/02/2024, 09:49 - Will-hazzer777: Well it probably works if you don't constantly add more dependents to it from outside.
18/02/2024, 09:49 - +44 7599 430972: But with inflation, market changes and etc the budget only grows
18/02/2024, 09:49 - +44 7599 430972: Even without increasing payload
18/02/2024, 09:50 - +44 7599 430972: You can look at nhs - it’s fundamental problem is not that there is too many people wishing to use it - it’s merely a symptom
18/02/2024, 09:50 - Will-hazzer777: I'm sure that can be factored in quite easily... The service types however do expand which is the problem... I'm hoping Starmer expands the system to the point of collapse.
18/02/2024, 09:51 - +44 7599 430972: Nah governments rarely shrink
18/02/2024, 09:51 - Will-hazzer777: Whats it's fundamental problem?
18/02/2024, 09:51 - +44 7599 430972: Over-management
18/02/2024, 09:51 - +44 7599 430972: Look at their IT-costs
18/02/2024, 09:51 - Will-hazzer777: Well the Tories cut lots of benefits
18/02/2024, 09:51 - +44 7599 430972: Each GP has own set of software
18/02/2024, 09:51 - +44 7599 430972: Consultant salaries breaching 600k
18/02/2024, 09:52 - +44 7599 430972: There are more contractors than in any other healthcare system in the world
18/02/2024, 09:52 - Will-hazzer777: Well hopefully the benefit system expands to the point of bankruptcy.
18/02/2024, 09:52 - +44 7599 430972: It looks like Brits just gave nhs extra money whenever there was a problem and they always choose the most expensive solution
18/02/2024, 09:53 - Will-hazzer777: That is partly the problem.... But it's the most expensive and inept solution too... Some things can't be fixed with money alone.
18/02/2024, 09:54 - +44 7599 430972: Well also when you run out of oil money
18/02/2024, 09:54 - Will-hazzer777: What oil money?
18/02/2024, 09:54 - +44 7599 430972: That’s the tragedy of public sector - it works well when economy works well and people rarely need it, but during collapse it collapses with economy when people need it the most
18/02/2024, 09:54 - +44 7599 430972: Northern sea
18/02/2024, 09:55 - Will-hazzer777: I don't think we see much of the revenues from that... We're not Norwegian...
18/02/2024, 09:56 - Will-hazzer777: Hopefully it collapses hard in the near future and never recovers.
18/02/2024, 09:56 - +44 7599 430972: Nah I don’t think so, brits are too socialist
18/02/2024, 09:56 - +44 7599 430972: They will build another system back up <This message was edited>
18/02/2024, 09:56 - Will-hazzer777: With what money?
18/02/2024, 09:57 - +44 7599 430972: With your taxes
18/02/2024, 09:57 - +44 7599 430972: Poor countries have public sector too
18/02/2024, 09:57 - +44 7599 430972: Look at Belarus
18/02/2024, 09:57 - Will-hazzer777: Increasingly we don't do anything on this island.
18/02/2024, 09:57 - Will-hazzer777: So taxes on what? Our public sector jobs?
18/02/2024, 09:58 - Will-hazzer777: They're paid for by taxes, they can't be the source of wealth.
18/02/2024, 09:58 - +44 7599 430972: Taxes on income, the main companies are gonna form
a govermental syndicate <This message was edited>
18/02/2024, 09:58 - Will-hazzer777: Our elites are hell bent on killing us by stealth anyway.
18/02/2024, 09:59 - +44 7599 430972: Like internet providers did already
18/02/2024, 09:59 - Will-hazzer777: Sure, income tax, but on what jobs? Public sector jobs don't create wealth. Only private sector jobs do that.
18/02/2024, 10:00 - +44 7599 430972: You can loon at Russia, 70% of their economy is governmental
18/02/2024, 10:00 - +44 7599 430972: Or Belarus
18/02/2024, 10:00 - Will-hazzer777: But at least they're selling stuff to foreign markets...
18/02/2024, 10:01 - Will-hazzer777: Gas, oil, minerals, lumber etc...
18/02/2024, 10:01 - +44 7599 430972: Belarus doesn’t export anything
18/02/2024, 10:02 - Will-hazzer777: Well it's part of Russia anyway.
18/02/2024, 10:02 - +44 7599 430972: Well you gonna be part of EU then
18/02/2024, 10:03 - Will-hazzer777: We kind of are still... I agree
18/02/2024, 10:03 - Will-hazzer777: But the EU is increasingly not doing much either...
18/02/2024, 10:04 - Will-hazzer777: Farming is going abroad... Europe is resource poor....
18/02/2024, 10:04 - Will-hazzer777: The Europeans are de-industrialising as we speak...
18/02/2024, 10:05 - +44 7599 430972: Well can’t blame people for doing what they think is right
18/02/2024, 10:05 - Will-hazzer777: Well we can blame people for getting that wrong though....
18/02/2024, 10:06 - +44 7599 430972: I believe in accountability
18/02/2024, 10:06 - +44 7599 430972: If someone is making a mistake they should be the one bearing the consequences
18/02/2024, 10:06 - Will-hazzer777: Sure, but we don't have any... Internally that is.
18/02/2024, 10:06 - +44 7599 430972: From what I’ve seen british public really believes in the benefit of nhs, govermental syndicates, etc
18/02/2024, 10:07 - +44 7599 430972: Who am I to tell them wrong
18/02/2024, 10:07 - Will-hazzer777: The analogy only works if you see countries as people.
18/02/2024, 10:07 - onur: yeah thats what I observed too
18/02/2024, 10:08 - Will-hazzer777: Yeah, well it's going to undo itself in the not too distant future.... I doubt the NHS will make it to 100.
18/02/2024, 10:08 - +44 7599 430972: They gonna make nhs v2
18/02/2024, 10:08 - +44 7599 430972: Go outside, speak with people
18/02/2024, 10:08 - +44 7599 430972: Everyone are loving nhs
18/02/2024, 10:08 - onur: _Nhs essentials_
18/02/2024, 10:08 - +44 7599 430972: And think it’s underfunded
18/02/2024, 10:09 - Will-hazzer777: An immigrants only service... Paid for by natives who aren't allowed to use it... That could work..
18/02/2024, 10:10 - +44 7599 430972: I would enjoy that <This message was edited>
18/02/2024, 10:11 - Will-hazzer777: Like I said before, it's not under funding, some problems can't be fixed by just chucking money at the problem...
18/02/2024, 10:11 - Will-hazzer777: Yeah... Lots of people would.
18/02/2024, 10:43 - +44 7894 560223: Why am I waking up to this in the group? It's not fun or a meme
18/02/2024, 10:43 - onur: is a meme
18/02/2024, 10:43 - Parag-meetup: Is it the elites or the recepients of social care , or everyone but you , is after you to get you ?
18/02/2024, 10:44 - Parag-meetup: Sorry what do you mean by that ?
18/02/2024, 10:44 - Will-hazzer777: Perhaps this is a conversation for the other group...
18/02/2024, 10:44 - +44 7894 560223: Yes please
18/02/2024, 10:44 - Parag-meetup: ??
18/02/2024, 10:46 - Parag-meetup: Most advanced countries in the world have a public health , education , social and transport system .. how is Britain an anomaly
18/02/2024, 10:47 - +44 7599 430972: Might be wrong correlation. Poor countries have public health, education, social and transport systems as well
18/02/2024, 10:47 - Parag-meetup: A because immigrants , come here and don’t work ?
18/02/2024, 10:50 - Parag-meetup: <Media omitted>
18/02/2024, 11:09 - Will-hazzer777: Needs correcting for age.
18/02/2024, 11:10 - Will-hazzer777: Very misleading...
18/02/2024, 11:13 - Parag-meetup: lol 
That’s the whole point 
Immigrants are all young healthy people , most of them work , anc work hard , otherwise they can’t afford anything including a good life for their children 

Natives are a mix of old , disabled and dysfunctional people who haven’t gone thru the screening of long travels and hard work capabilities
18/02/2024, 11:19 - Will-hazzer777: They might actually be a drain, if you corrected for age... Plus these are just EU immigrants.
18/02/2024, 11:58 - Parag-meetup: How do you think they might be a net drain 
Is it just your disdain or an excuse of not thriving
18/02/2024, 11:59 - Parag-meetup: Figures show they provide more and take less than natives 
Figures show they comit less crime than natives 

Logic dictates the same 

I don’t see where your knowledge comes from
18/02/2024, 12:00 - Will-hazzer777: I'm not saying they are .... They might be... The calculations would need to be done.
18/02/2024, 12:00 - Will-hazzer777: Like I said it's not corrected for age.
18/02/2024, 12:04 - Parag-meetup: Great , so you don’t have the calculations , you just supose 
Why ?
18/02/2024, 12:04 - Parag-meetup: Why do you have this bias 
Is there any logic behind it 

Or just it feels good , to blame someone for your troubles
18/02/2024, 12:07 - Will-hazzer777: I don't have to provide the calculations.. your be the one making claims. You don't have any calculations just biased statistics.
18/02/2024, 12:12 - Parag-meetup: No you do 
You made the claim
18/02/2024, 12:12 - Parag-meetup: This !
18/02/2024, 12:18 - Will-hazzer777: No your claim is that EU nationals are more employed than British people...., I've explained why it's biased and you shouldn't take stats at face value.
18/02/2024, 12:18 - Will-hazzer777: What about that?
18/02/2024, 12:22 - Parag-meetup: It was a reply to the your claim that they will take while natives will provide
18/02/2024, 12:24 - Parag-meetup: <Media omitted>
18/02/2024, 12:26 - +44 7599 430972: BTW has anyone seen migration contribution breakdown by country of origin? I remember I saw Dutch figures once but can't find it now
18/02/2024, 12:28 - Will-hazzer777: I'm not saying that... I'm just saying that could work...
18/02/2024, 12:28 - Will-hazzer777: Not saying it would be good
18/02/2024, 12:29 - Will-hazzer777: Let's move the conversation to the other group... This is just for memes.

You are rollicking on the fear train today
22/02/2024, 12:48 - +91 80720 44735: And the worst thing is that he is absolutely petrified of some crazy shit with <1% probability, and he is delusionally and blissfully ignorant about real dangers we are currently living through, like the Climate Crisis or the global pandemic or a  Crisis of Democracy
22/02/2024, 12:48 - +44 7599 430972: or british food
22/02/2024, 12:50 - Will-hazzer777: NHS doctors go to Poland for their hip replacements...
22/02/2024, 12:50 - +91 80720 44735: Not to say that the NHS isn't in a crisis, but 'saving up to have medical treatment outside the UK'? The NHS crisis has been a long time in the making, with deep, repeated budget cuts, the ultimate self goal
22/02/2024, 12:51 - +91 80720 44735: Budget cuts sound cool, until the hospital food becomes jail food
22/02/2024, 12:52 - Will-hazzer777: Can't continue bringing in dependent people from abroad that suddenly need NHS services and expect there not to be a crisis... There is no money to pay for these people.
22/02/2024, 12:52 - +91 80720 44735: Like, 'I'm so smart, I'll just reduce the NHS budget and tell the doctors to treat us cheaper and better!'
22/02/2024, 12:53 - Will-hazzer777: Where's the NHS budget been reduced?
22/02/2024, 12:53 - +91 80720 44735: Again, with that bs? Incoming people are ineligible for NHS for the first 6 months - as a percentage, how many of them have been accessing the NHS budget?
22/02/2024, 12:54 - +44 7452 968792: That’s true, it’s so much cheaper
22/02/2024, 12:54 - +44 7452 968792: I think some of the conservative MPs have written a book about privatising the NHS

22/02/2024, 12:56 - +44 7599 430972: How about instead of increasing the budget we just get rid of this dude and pay 6 doctors 100k?
22/02/2024, 12:56 - +91 80720 44735: While we're at it, why don't we ask Elon Musk if 200 billion is enough to live on Planet Earth? Is that why he wants to 'Occupy Mars'?
22/02/2024, 12:56 - Will-hazzer777: 6 months flies by quite quickly... If you come on a boat however you're on a priority list.
22/02/2024, 12:57 - +91 80720 44735: Yeah, like those surviving the sea crossings on a life raft all come here seeking chemotherapy and new kidneys
22/02/2024, 12:57 - +44 7599 430972: Bear in mind that there are GPs and there are 30 y/o 300k+ champagne socialists who think nhs should fund their salary more
22/02/2024, 12:57 - Will-hazzer777: That's not because they're being sent to Poland by the NHS... They're going there because it takes 6 months or more for a hip replacement on the NHS, they're paying out of their own pockets.
22/02/2024, 12:58 - +44 7452 968792: 6 months for a hip replacement waiting list? Damn
22/02/2024, 12:58 - +91 80720 44735: And there's no 300k+ docs in the USA? They're all private, so you just pay 300% more in terms of hospital bills!!
22/02/2024, 12:59 - +44 7599 430972: What’s that has to do with anything? US is private so we should have ultra-rich doctors?
22/02/2024, 13:00 - +91 80720 44735: Doctors operate in a global economy - if you don't pay a British doc atleast 70-80% of what he can make in the US or Australia, then the British docs will just pack up and leave
22/02/2024, 13:00 - +91 80720 44735: And then, enter @⁨Parag-meetup⁩ lol
22/02/2024, 13:01 - +44 7599 430972: Or so we should compete with overpriced US healthcare without US economy?
22/02/2024, 13:01 - +44 7599 430972: I mean this could be applied to any job
22/02/2024, 13:01 - +91 80720 44735: And then @⁨Will-hazzer777⁩ feels even more scared of 'Cultural Replacement by Immigrants' lol
22/02/2024, 13:01 - +44 7599 430972: Plumbers, bus drivers
22/02/2024, 13:02 - +44 7599 430972: Also haven’t seen the same issue with Poland where everyone are getting their hopes hips replaces? Maybe Poles pay their doctors 800k
22/02/2024, 13:02 - +91 80720 44735: The only thing stopping British Docs from moving to the USA is the regulations - they'd need to appear for exams again - so they leave to Canada, Aus, NZ
22/02/2024, 13:03 - +44 7599 430972: Good riddance
22/02/2024, 13:03 - +44 7599 430972: Maybe a proper country with proper economy value them more
22/02/2024, 13:03 - +91 80720 44735: Cost of living is lower in Poland, hence the cost of hip replacements will be naturally lower, too <This message was edited>
22/02/2024, 13:04 - +44 7599 430972: Yeah I wonder why is it lower… 🤔
22/02/2024, 13:04 - +91 80720 44735: Because Warsaw is not London
22/02/2024, 13:05 - +44 7599 430972: Wow so insightful
22/02/2024, 13:05 - +44 7599 430972: We should definitely listen to this guy when it comes to budgets 👆
22/02/2024, 13:05 - +91 80720 44735: And Russian Oligarchs don't carry out their money laundering operations from Poland, they use 'Western Countries' where the 'Rule of law' prevails
22/02/2024, 13:06 - +91 80720 44735: Thanks, I thought so too ☺️🤭
22/02/2024, 13:06 - +44 7599 430972: Oh so Russian oligarchs are to blame?
22/02/2024, 13:06 - +44 7599 430972: Did they rise cost of living in Australia, NZ and US as well?
22/02/2024, 13:06 - +91 80720 44735: Just one example of why prices are so much higher in London than Warsaw
22/02/2024, 13:06 - +44 7599 430972: Only one?
22/02/2024, 13:06 - +91 80720 44735: US surely
22/02/2024, 13:07 - +44 7599 430972: There is nothing else?
22/02/2024, 13:07 - +91 80720 44735: No there is nothing else
22/02/2024, 13:07 - +91 80720 44735: Everything is the Russians' fault
22/02/2024, 13:07 - +44 7599 430972: Well sad that British were stupid enough to allow this to happen
22/02/2024, 13:07 - +44 7599 430972: Good riddance, never doubted Russia for a second 🤝
22/02/2024, 13:08 - +44 7599 430972: Can’t wait for US fall as well
22/02/2024, 13:08 - +91 80720 44735: Just don't hold your breath
22/02/2024, 13:08 - +44 7599 430972: I won’t - I am not a migrant in US
22/02/2024, 13:09 - +44 7599 430972: no reason for me to worry
22/02/2024, 13:09 - Will-hazzer777: That's not really the problem, the problem if front and foremost to do with dependency and long term cost vs short term benefit (if any).
22/02/2024, 13:13 - +44 7599 430972: The problem is that british people are having too much money and we need to make sure they have less
22/02/2024, 13:13 - +44 7599 430972: And I work hard, day and night, to achieve this
22/02/2024, 13:13 - +91 80720 44735: Tax them more and hire more hip doctors <This message was edited>
22/02/2024, 13:14 - +44 7599 430972: Nah the plan is to tax more and then embezzle money using trust funds and only paying high figures to army and consultant doctors
22/02/2024, 13:14 - +44 7599 430972: This plan didn’t fail me in any autocracy
22/02/2024, 13:15 - +91 80720 44735: Tax trust funds and levy inheritance tax, then
22/02/2024, 13:15 - +44 7599 430972: And then public will pick the minority group to ostracise
22/02/2024, 13:15 - +44 7599 430972: Works as clocks
22/02/2024, 13:15 - +44 7599 430972: Why would I do that
22/02/2024, 13:15 - +44 7599 430972: I hate this place with utmost passion
22/02/2024, 13:15 - +91 80720 44735: To be able to afford more hip doctors?
22/02/2024, 13:16 - +91 80720 44735: True love?
22/02/2024, 13:16 - +44 7599 430972: Honey, people with 100k and above can afford them
22/02/2024, 13:16 - +44 7599 430972: It’s this unfortunate middle class that we need to get rid of
22/02/2024, 13:16 - +44 7599 430972: Who’s you think gonna pay all these new taxes
22/02/2024, 13:16 - +91 80720 44735: If you had even a 1% wealth tax, you could get 10,000 more hip doctors
22/02/2024, 13:17 - +44 7599 430972: Yeah funny, like government cares much hip doctors it has
22/02/2024, 13:17 - +91 80720 44735: Well, @⁨Will-hazzer777⁩ does
22/02/2024, 13:17 - +44 7599 430972: Keep the creme de la creme happy and you’re set
22/02/2024, 13:18 - +44 7599 430972: Will is a commie in disguise
22/02/2024, 13:18 - +44 7958 612614: you mean - if you had enough money to pay for 10k hip doctors - you'd be able to afford them? casual tautology
22/02/2024, 13:18 - +91 80720 44735: Or just have a revolution and get rid of the creme de la creme
22/02/2024, 13:18 - +44 7599 430972: Sure, go ahead <This message was edited>
22/02/2024, 13:18 - +44 7599 430972: British people are infamously revolutionary
22/02/2024, 13:19 - +44 7599 430972: Just make sure not to write about it in whatsapp chats since it’s easy to trace
22/02/2024, 13:19 - +91 80720 44735: If NHS hired 10k more hip doctors, the avg British citizen wouldn't need to 'pay' for hip replacement
22/02/2024, 13:19 - +91 80720 44735: and wouldn't need to travel to Poland either

22/02/2024, 13:20 - +44 7958 612614: If food @ supermarkets was free - British citizens wouldn’t need to pay for their food
22/02/2024, 13:20 - +91 80720 44735: Unless one of you rats me out!! Lol

22/02/2024, 13:20 - +44 7599 430972: Wasting Russian budgets?
22/02/2024, 13:22 - +44 7958 612614: chatting?  just a guess
22/02/2024, 13:22 - +91 80720 44735: NHS treatment is free to people classed as ordinarily resident in the UK https://www.england.nhs.uk/pay-syst/

22/02/2024, 13:23 - +44 7599 430972: Not really true since skilled migrants pay IHS
22/02/2024, 13:23 - +44 7599 430972: only marxist commies are internationalists
22/02/2024, 13:23 - Will-hazzer777: Nor would NHS doctors...

22/02/2024, 13:25 - +44 7958 612614: communism doesn’t recognise capitalistic borders
22/02/2024, 13:25 - +44 7599 430972: funny, I remember Putin saying that
22/02/2024, 13:25 - Will-hazzer777: Just print more money..... And inflate the currency more...
22/02/2024, 13:25 - +44 7599 430972: Or just donate?
22/02/2024, 13:25 - Will-hazzer777: An interesting thought...
22/02/2024, 13:26 - +44 7599 430972: Like how much do you on average donate to charities or public services per month?
22/02/2024, 13:26 - +44 7599 430972: 10% of income?
22/02/2024, 13:26 - +44 7958 612614: well, he got a giggle out of you...
22/02/2024, 13:26 - Will-hazzer777: International Capitalism doesn't recognise borders.
22/02/2024, 13:26 - +44 7599 430972: You keep using this term like capitalism recognises “nations”
22/02/2024, 13:27 - +44 7958 612614: which means - it’s actually communism.
22/02/2024, 13:27 - +44 7958 612614: no, silly - there’s a right and wrong type of capitalism.  the right one recognises them..
22/02/2024, 13:27 - +44 7599 430972: I’ve told you - we’ve been fooled by commies again
22/02/2024, 13:27 - +44 7599 430972: They learned how to pretend to be conservatives
22/02/2024, 13:28 - Will-hazzer777: Mmm crony capitalism is a variety of communism.
22/02/2024, 13:29 - +44 7958 612614: the Tories are communists?
22/02/2024, 13:29 - +44 7599 430972: It’s just europe regressing back to feudalism - they tried personal freedoms and didn’t like it that much
22/02/2024, 13:30 - Will-hazzer777: Any system that believes in 'too big to fail', is communist.
22/02/2024, 13:31 - Will-hazzer777: More or less, labour light...
22/02/2024, 13:31 - +44 7599 430972: What about quantity to quality?
22/02/2024, 13:31 - +44 7958 612614: So international capitalism is too big to fail?
22/02/2024, 13:31 - +44 7599 430972: Didn’t you read Engels?
22/02/2024, 13:32 - +44 7958 612614: Engels is in da haus!
22/02/2024, 13:32 - Will-hazzer777: Well if it's bailed out by tax payers and is dependent on and given preferential treatment by national governments, yeah...
22/02/2024, 13:32 - +44 7958 612614: ok, so it’s evolutionary superior - the survival of the fittest
22/02/2024, 13:33 - Will-hazzer777: Its the survival of the most parasitic, which will kill its host eventually.
22/02/2024, 13:34 - +44 7958 612614: You lie to me!  The statement that "evolution is the survival of the most parasitic" is not accurate and does not reflect the principles of evolutionary theory as understood by scientists.
22/02/2024, 13:35 - +44 7599 430972: Come on with this dialectics, just tax poor people more for our doctor overlords

Has anyone of you listened to Eric about the "new physics", and how it's been (actively) ignored by the mainstream physics community?

What do you make of his claims?

13/03/2024, 13:18 - Will-hazzer777: Almost everyone was poor then... If you could get an education you were rich.
13/03/2024, 13:20 - +44 7958 612614: Being born was considered wealth in itself - born in a family - that’s like a bonus
13/03/2024, 13:36 - Will-hazzer777: Not at all being born today is considered wealthy, not in the past... Being born today means that your mother chose to have you and believed her circumstances are reasonable enough to allow you to be born.
13/03/2024, 13:42 - Parag-meetup: Conceptually and theoretically , you can say that if you are doing well enough and are positioned well to do a lot for the world yourself , then you don’t need to gamble on a new person - a child . 
The gamble is that with time as the world progresses , the future generations will be able to do much more for the world than we are in our limited life . 
There are many vairiables at play : including others producing children no matter what , your child might be challenged and the time and effort it takes to raise a child and what it takes away from your own life to succeed
13/03/2024, 13:45 - Will-hazzer777: Does this explain why you brought a child into the world? You needed to gamble on a new person because you're not personally positioned well enough to do a lot for the world?
13/03/2024, 13:47 - +44 7958 612614: this is such a non-philosophical perspective - i wonder if you and parag are related 🙄.  you're saying that's no inherent value to life and being?
13/03/2024, 13:48 - Parag-meetup: Yups , the balance 
In my opinion I am at a position where I can spare time for this gamble
13/03/2024, 13:48 - Will-hazzer777: I'm not saying that at all... I'm saying that marx wasn't poor.
13/03/2024, 13:48 - Parag-meetup: It’s a very high yield gamble now
13/03/2024, 13:49 - Will-hazzer777: He was a scrounger.

13/03/2024, 13:49 - Parag-meetup: The value of life can be positive or negative

13/03/2024, 13:49 - +44 7958 612614: no, it's inherently positive

13/03/2024, 13:51 - +44 7958 612614: life is potential - potential is always a value
13/03/2024, 13:51 - Parag-meetup: I’m following your suit

13/03/2024, 13:51 - Parag-meetup: Potential to be positive or negative

13/03/2024, 13:52 - Will-hazzer777: It is like a time share sort of arrangement? Sell your soul for a decade or three?
13/03/2024, 13:52 - +44 7958 612614: no, potential in itself  is positive (and it's not subject to judgment) - you're talking about another layer of qualitative evaluation where that's possible
13/03/2024, 13:53 - Parag-meetup: You really of my understand the concept of buying time ?
13/03/2024, 13:53 - Parag-meetup: You buy services which save you time
13/03/2024, 13:53 - Will-hazzer777: Ooo what kind of services?
13/03/2024, 13:53 - Parag-meetup: Also you can position yourself where you can perform better without much time , at some point
13/03/2024, 13:54 - Parag-meetup: Almost any service
13/03/2024, 13:54 - onur: if you have two computer screens over one

15/03/2024, 09:59 - Will-hazzer777: "The hemline index is a theory that suggests that skirt length (hemlines) rise or fall along with stock prices. The most common version of the theory is that skirt lengths get shorter in good economic times (1920s, 1960s)[1] and longer in bad, such as after the 1929 Wall Street Crash."

19/04/2024, 14:49 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: For what it's worth, my diagnosis of Trump: 

*Antisocial personality disorder*

"Antisocial personality disorder is a particularly challenging type of personality disorder characterised by impulsive, irresponsible and often criminal behaviour.

Someone with APD will typically be manipulative, deceitful and reckless, and will not care for other people's feelings.

Like other types of personality disorder, APD is on a spectrum, which means it can range in severity from occasional bad behaviour to repeatedly breaking the law and committing serious crimes."
19/04/2024, 14:50 - Parag-meetup: I think he’s just old school dumb and rich
19/04/2024, 14:50 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: An ordinary man with APD will eventually run into issues, seek help and get support.

But a protected, rich guy who divorces, fires or cuts off anyone who he dislikes, can get through life never realising (or accepting) himself.... not getting diagnosed and be treated.
19/04/2024, 14:55 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: Yes, true,... but the number of felonies, evidence, and stupid things this man (at 77 yrs) has done/said, begs for an explanation other than rich & (not-always) dumb. 

Everything about him can be explained if we look at him having APD.
19/04/2024, 14:56 - Parag-meetup: Well anti social personality is according to me just a person who isn’t very disciplined and becasue of reasons ( in his case , privilidge ) not afraid of law . He can get away easily , as did many entitles people
19/04/2024, 15:01 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: His behaviour shows lack of awareness of wrong, from right.
And in those instances where he might be aware, he shows recklessness... 
This is a life long behaviour.. where he won't even consider his family's welfare or reputation. 

A person without a disorder, would know the most _correct actions_, under most circumstances. He shows all signs of being oblivious.
19/04/2024, 15:10 - Parag-meetup: I must say I have lived a similar entitled life and can understand this thought process 

It’s not that he is not aware , it’s that he easily puts it behind him and not feel guilty , justifies them in his own mind becasue it is helping him achieve his goals
19/04/2024, 15:16 - +44 7958 612614: APD  is also known as sociopathy or psychopathy
19/04/2024, 15:17 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: Fair point.

I think the media is doing a mistake treating him as a "healthy wealthy man who is just wierd and narcissistic".
 
He has a disorder, which is compelling him to do wrong... (taxes, infidelity, lies, corruption, false promises, cutting corners, courtroom misconduct, childish lies, etc)... his behaviour won't stop.

Didn't we have in this chat before a somewhat interesting breakdown of white Americans heritage?

Think it kind of broke down where multiple heritages were noted, but while British was highest % it wasn't a much larger minority than other European heritages.

22/04/2024, 21:44 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: Genes affecting appearance are a tiny fraction of all genes. 

Our internal organs, and our physical functioning, is identical across our species (miniscule variations apart), since we migrated out of Africa. 

Populations have to breed in isolation for generations before there are any distinct genetic differences. 

Alcohol metabolism & heart-disease risk might be ones that come closest to internal race-genetic differences. <This message was edited>
23/04/2024, 00:08 - Will-hazzer777: If our differences are as you say only skin deep how is it that when when people need blood transfusions or organ transplants, good matches are only found amongst ones own racial/ethnic group?
23/04/2024, 00:09 - onur: small differences result in different looks :D
23/04/2024, 09:01 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: We carry differet types of variations, and blood antigens (immune system, etc) are variations unrelated to race differences. These differences existed probably even when we were in Africa.

Our racial differences were influenced by the environment and inbreeding. Our bodies tolerate benign differences (like skin, etc), but for the rest of the body (structure, function), there isn't much variation. Our lung, hearts, intestines etc are pretty much the same everywhere.

23/04/2024, 10:25 - Will-hazzer777: If I needed blood, I couldn't necessarily take yours, if I needed an organ transplant, I couldn't necessarily biologically accept it. Your organs might have adaptions to them that mine don't or vice versa. Those adaptions to environment, of which there are many will continue to perpetuate in the long term. The modern era isn't likely to be with us in the long term to shield us from it's ravages. <This message was edited>

23/04/2024, 16:21 - +44 7958 612614: imagine you have a rock band and it's all whites people - you introduce another race - from the point of swapping organs, you might find it to be non homogenous - but in terms of music creation - you might find it to be tuning the band'a DNA towards optimallity
23/04/2024, 16:23 - +44 7958 612614: important thing is to assume this goals orientation - just testing that were not the same can only be valuable if we think that being the same is the desired goal - or true nature - but it's exactly the opposite
23/04/2024, 16:31 - Will-hazzer777: There is no goal to evolution and therefore variation other than survival within a particular ecology.

23/04/2024, 16:59 - +44 7958 612614: evolution has a built in mechanism for change - that's what if does - changing, transforming, fine tuning - but as a continuous process, not as in making perfect

23/04/2024, 17:17 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: If you operate on several racially different people and lay out their  internals, you won't be able to point out the differences.

If we look at finer details (genetics), we will see minor gene _variants_ (also copy numbers) that would make each of us distinct, yet belonging to the same large group/species.

The closest other primate is 99.8% identical at that level of detail (genome sequence), which gives us an idea of how identical we humans must be at the genetic level.
23/04/2024, 17:18 - Will-hazzer777: No, not profound... Things get more complex when you start trying to use Ferrari parts to fix a Maserati...

23/04/2024, 17:28 - +44 7958 612614: anyway, you care too much about yourself - it's not like humanity will notice...
23/04/2024, 17:29 - Will-hazzer777: Well it's probably the reason why nobody's talking about why mixed race people are dying at a higher rate than any other group in terms of excess deaths in this country.

Disproportionately less than others
29/04/2024, 14:52 - Will-hazzer777: Disproportionately more... People are just reluctant to admit it. You can't add millions of people to a country in short spaces of time and for everything to get more expensive, dirty and congested.

02/05/2024, 11:23 - +44 7599 430972: So are the soviets - “Soviet men program”
02/05/2024, 11:23 - Will-hazzer777: I mean everyone is a leftie if you contort it enough to fit a definition.
02/05/2024, 11:24 - +44 7599 430972: I think in modern terms it means “accelerated collectivism without genetical determinism”
02/05/2024, 11:24 - +44 7599 430972: Hitler didn’t believe in genes for example

02/05/2024, 11:29 - +44 7599 430972: The blood related myths were popular around this time, the genes idea was not so widespread yet
02/05/2024, 13:55 - Will-hazzer777: They always tried to link Darwin and eugenics to the Nazis though... Is that not true?
02/05/2024, 13:56 - +44 7599 430972: Depends, nazis never really based their ideas on science

04/08/2024, 12:41 - onur: she lost to the thai one semi finals
04/08/2024, 12:41 - onur: 😣
04/08/2024, 12:46 - Parag-meetup: Seems unfair , she looks kuch much bigger and ferocious than the Thai one
04/08/2024, 12:46 - Parag-meetup: I may be it was fixed
04/08/2024, 12:50 - onur: she beat her back in 2019

04/08/2024, 12:58 - +353 89 605 0161: I don't get what's happening with this.
Wasn't she "assigned" female at birth.
She's not trans, no?
04/08/2024, 13:00 - +353 89 605 0161: She's just manly...?

One test said she had a Y chromosome but that's news to her apparently and the test wasn't confirmed by anyone else.
04/08/2024, 13:05 - onur: as far as I have read she has xy chromosome but assigned female at birth, she was banned from the last championship because she couldn't pass the gender test
04/08/2024, 13:08 - +353 89 605 0161: The IBA says she does, but nobody has seen the tests and nobody else has conducted their own tests.

06/08/2024, 09:36 - onur: no whats up?
06/08/2024, 09:37 - Parag-meetup: I thought all Turkish people love their women’s volleyball team
06/08/2024, 09:37 - onur: we do go sultans
06/08/2024, 09:38 - onur: but some people (islamists) dont support them
06/08/2024, 09:38 - onur: if thats what you are asking
06/08/2024, 09:39 - onur: because some of the players have alternative lifestyles and they always speak about republic values

06/08/2024, 09:42 - onur: she isnt a trans
06/08/2024, 09:43 - onur: but she is gay
06/08/2024, 09:44 - onur: she ugly but she is womenly i mean her behaviour 😅
06/08/2024, 09:44 - Parag-meetup: They won against China , into semis now
06/08/2024, 09:45 - onur: nice i'll watch it
06/08/2024, 09:45 - onur: i talk to an egyptian friend and she says that algerian boxer is a she too, i mean its not a controversy back there
06/08/2024, 09:49 - +353 89 605 0161: I think these are mostly for slow news days and the 'controversy' is overstated/manufactured everywhere.

But, if they're going to be doing these tests to decide who can take part then they need to ditch the men's and women's distinction and just have testosterone classes the same way they have weight classes.
06/08/2024, 09:49 - +44 7599 430972: Back to testosterone again
06/08/2024, 09:50 - +44 7599 430972: A year ago you called me madman
06/08/2024, 09:50 - +44 7599 430972: In a year you gonna call me messiah?
06/08/2024, 09:50 - +353 89 605 0161: You were calling for test injections!
06/08/2024, 09:50 - onur: as far as i have researched women wanted to have a separate competition because they weren't facilitating enough women games
06/08/2024, 09:50 - onur: in 1992

06/08/2024, 09:53 - +44 7599 430972: I have a theory that people reconvert into the religion they been taught as a kid as they grow old
06/08/2024, 09:55 - +353 89 605 0161: Why?
Fall out of step with the current culture and retreat to something more stable?
06/08/2024, 09:55 - +44 7599 430972: Idk, fear of death, or perhaps they close all the Geshtalts that drove them off their core beliefs
06/08/2024, 09:55 - +44 7599 430972: There is a similar thing with older people becoming more patriotic
06/08/2024, 09:56 - +44 7599 430972: You can read up the views of people that were _expelled_ from USSR after revolution on Russian culture at their deathbed
06/08/2024, 09:56 - +44 7599 430972: Puts modern day nationalists to shame
06/08/2024, 09:56 - onur: i followed until the second tweet
06/08/2024, 09:58 - onur: if you are raised as an atheist maybe, or a non religious family, but if you refute religion logically, there is no coming back 😅 how can you sincerely believe something doesnt exist?
06/08/2024, 09:59 - onur: as you get older, lonelier or isolated; you will be drawn to these religion, cult or nationalism stuff because these stuff are social and acceptant
06/08/2024, 09:59 - +44 7599 430972: I also see rise of commies in Russia as dialectics is their legitimate view of the world, they haven’t been taught any other
06/08/2024, 09:59 - +44 7599 430972: Like ex-Christians still follow Chrisrian morale without realising
06/08/2024, 10:00 - onur: it might be because of a social need of acceptance and being a member of a society
06/08/2024, 10:00 - +44 7599 430972: Gone with the Wind type of conversion?
06/08/2024, 10:02 - onur: idk that. But these are the people cults target
06/08/2024, 10:03 - +44 7599 430972: In Gone with the Wind main hero who is a typical antisocial type starts acting very socially acceptable after he has kids
06/08/2024, 10:03 - onur: i dont know elon musk, i dont know how much he philosophized atheism, but i think once you are an atheist it is very unlikely to go back because there isn't only 1 discrepancy but there are millions
06/08/2024, 10:03 - +44 7599 430972: Because he wants a better future and acceptance for them
06/08/2024, 10:03 - onur: very nice and interesting topic
06/08/2024, 10:03 - onur: I'll check
06/08/2024, 10:04 - +44 7599 430972: I am pretty sure a lot of pastors are atheists
06/08/2024, 10:04 - onur: yes in that case its similar with what I am saying
06/08/2024, 10:04 - onur: probably :D
06/08/2024, 10:04 - +44 7599 430972: Who interpret bible as “interesting ancient text” and think of it as a “moral exercise” than actual word of god
06/08/2024, 10:04 - +44 7599 430972: Spiritualism kind of vibes
06/08/2024, 10:04 - onur: yeah there are some new churches like that and waves
06/08/2024, 10:05 - onur: and also I am sure some pastors are faking it just to get by
06/08/2024, 10:05 - onur: if that's where you raised, what you gonna do? You'll have to play by
06/08/2024, 10:05 - onur: sometimes the only job available is that in a small place
06/08/2024, 10:06 - onur: or life can direct you to that point
06/08/2024, 10:07 - onur: as far as i know elon is raised in a rich somewhat unattentive family and absent father
06/08/2024, 10:07 - onur: so i dont think he gave a fight to leave the religion in the first place
06/08/2024, 10:07 - onur: so his atheism might not be as strong
06/08/2024, 10:07 - +44 7599 430972: Well also kids have grown up
06/08/2024, 10:07 - +44 7599 430972: There is nothing else to explore in business
06/08/2024, 10:08 - +44 7599 430972: He probably starts asking questions like “why am I here”
06/08/2024, 10:08 - +44 7599 430972: Unfortunately science does not answer those
06/08/2024, 10:09 - onur: it does but u need to research much more and try to understand 😅 

the religion kills the curiosity and there isnt a need to learn a new thing after that tbh
06/08/2024, 10:11 - +44 7599 430972: I think at some age curiosity just dies naturally
06/08/2024, 10:14 - onur: maybe
06/08/2024, 10:16 - onur: but i think people who remain curious will stay curious most of the time, in the office there are old people who are very proficient with Ai
06/08/2024, 10:16 - onur: and i know some young people who haven't even seen the UI of chatgpt
06/08/2024, 10:16 - +44 7599 430972: Yeah but is that a requirement? Imagine you had a long tiresome life and then someone tells you “be curious” <This message was edited>
06/08/2024, 10:17 - +44 7599 430972: “educate yourself”
06/08/2024, 10:17 - +44 7599 430972: Some people deserve rest
06/08/2024, 10:17 - onur: its not a requirement but the ones who were curious will try to follow the news i mean :D its not that hard
06/08/2024, 10:17 - onur: once you learn how to learn
06/08/2024, 10:19 - +44 7599 430972: Maybe, my point is more that there is nothing wrong with reverting back to religion
06/08/2024, 10:19 - onur: depends on the religion and your aim I guess
06/08/2024, 10:20 - onur: if you try to catch the social and ritualistic sides of it, yeah seems harmless
06/08/2024, 10:20 - onur: but if you were REALLY not believing before but now REALLY believing in it, somethings wrong with this 😅
06/08/2024, 10:21 - onur: its inconsistent
06/08/2024, 10:21 - +44 7599 430972: I don’t think belief is a monolith thing
06/08/2024, 10:21 - +44 7599 430972: You can believe but doubt
06/08/2024, 10:21 - +44 7599 430972: You may not believe but have lingering hope it’s true
06/08/2024, 10:22 - onur: What's true tho? this is deism
06/08/2024, 10:22 - onur: not religionn
06/08/2024, 10:23 - +44 7599 430972: There is also pragmatic truth, something that is useful although does not have enough evidence it corresponds with reality
06/08/2024, 11:43 - onur: <Media omitted>
06/08/2024, 11:55 - Parag-meetup: lol 
Where does this theory come from ?
06/08/2024, 11:56 - Parag-meetup: Why will you grow lonlier or isolated ?
06/08/2024, 11:58 - +44 7394 986609: Are the majority of the population limited neurologically to only wanting to  believe somthing devine? <This message was edited>
06/08/2024, 12:05 - +353 89 605 0161: Old people's friends die off.
If they have family they might keep them busy but it isn't the same as companionship.
Loneliness is the new hot topic for elderly care
06/08/2024, 12:06 - Parag-meetup: I think it was a thing of past 
Not anymore 
Believing in fairies when you grow senile
06/08/2024, 12:06 - +44 7599 430972: Mostly people my age becoming more conservative and religious. Also famous people like Richter, Blavatsky, Kantor, Peterson, Wagner, Tolstoy
06/08/2024, 12:07 - +44 7599 430972: No I don’t think it’s a brain thing. I think people operate on some core assumptions they take in when they grow up
06/08/2024, 12:08 - Parag-meetup: I can see the appeal , when you are doubtful . 
But in today’s world there’s little doubt
06/08/2024, 12:08 - +44 7599 430972: Like I notice people that moved from Russia still think like Marxists despite being openly anti-communist
06/08/2024, 12:08 - +44 7599 430972: It’s just hard to adopt completely different paradigm I guess
06/08/2024, 12:10 - Parag-meetup: If that was the case there would be no change in the stats of the religiosness of the world 

The fact that it changes means people don’t come back to their original religion and pass it on to their children 

It’s mainly a one way street , more intelligence and evidence and understanding of the world correlates with not believing in the fairy tales
06/08/2024, 12:10 - +353 89 605 0161: Turning to religion or loneliness?
06/08/2024, 12:11 - Parag-meetup: Turning to religion
06/08/2024, 12:11 - +44 7599 430972: Yeah definitely, Christianity is on the decline
06/08/2024, 12:12 - Parag-meetup: Now they just turn on tv or tik tok
06/08/2024, 12:12 - onur: i think yes
06/08/2024, 12:12 - onur: i think so
06/08/2024, 12:12 - +353 89 605 0161: You could still have a late life reconversion but a drift to non-belief in general.
If they are non believers during the ages they're raising their kids then the kids will be raised non-believers. <This message was edited>
06/08/2024, 12:12 - Parag-meetup: Every religion percentage wise is on a decline 
Except may be scientism and switfies
06/08/2024, 12:14 - +44 7599 430972: By percentage do you mean believers amongst ethnic group? Because in total numbers they are increasing
06/08/2024, 12:17 - Parag-meetup: Yups any group 
That’s what matters 
Not that there are more people in the world now
06/08/2024, 12:18 - Parag-meetup: Not to mention the religiosity , adherence
06/08/2024, 12:19 - onur: it should be because of population increase

06/08/2024, 12:23 - onur: In the case of the United States, those who reply “none” when asked about religion, have grown from 8 percent of the population in 2000 to 21 percent in 2022. In China and Japan, along with South Korea, North Korea, Czechia and Estonia, the majority of the populations have no religious affiliation.
06/08/2024, 12:24 - +44 7599 430972: Where are you getting the data from
06/08/2024, 12:24 - onur: but u cant really predict an atheist, they are predicting it as like muslim kids will be muslim etc

06/08/2024, 12:25 - onur: i was checking this
06/08/2024, 12:39 - +44 7394 986609: Can ones ideas evolve/transcend young bias/fallacies by rigorous evidence based hammering as they get older?

Or will there always be this blind spot fallacy in your cognitive thinking because where flesh and blood?
06/08/2024, 12:39 - +44 7599 430972: Sure they can
06/08/2024, 12:39 - +44 7599 430972: The question is why
06/08/2024, 12:40 - +44 7599 430972: Will your religiousness help you or hinder you when you’re 80 yo?
06/08/2024, 12:43 - +44 7394 986609: Fascinating. 

Now I understand the interest in simulation computer programs that try to predict the 'next stage' of human brain or a brain evolution built by big computer companies.

Like they say about paying for sex; you're not paying for sex, you're paying for them to leave afterwards.

Sometimes people want a cuddle, without anything else 🤷‍♂

20/08/2024, 11:15 - +44 7599 430972: So they sometimes reinvent lamer versions of known cultural concepts
20/08/2024, 11:16 - onur: who is they

20/08/2024, 11:19 - +44 7599 430972: Like the idea that all mythos actually spawns from the universal proto-mythos

20/08/2024, 11:23 - onur: prophets etc..
20/08/2024, 11:24 - onur: so its normal that they move around and affect each other and merge into each other
20/08/2024, 11:24 - +44 7599 430972: Those sort of links between different mythos is what led to creation of “New Chronology” by Newton - idea that all the important archrtypes like Heracles, Jesus, etc existed universally amongst all cultures
20/08/2024, 11:24 - +44 7599 430972: And then it created new-age religions like Blavatsky’s

23/08/2024, 10:11 - Parag-meetup: Explain
23/08/2024, 10:14 - onur: It's the 8th art, a culture, a nice way to spend time, most of them require some sort of strategy, learning and skill, and there are multiple genres of it so you can find your genre as well.

so i would react similarly if someone said "i dont like listening to music much" & " i don't like watching/ playing videogameS" <This message was edited>

23/08/2024, 11:33 - +353 89 605 0161: Between hobby and addiction?

If it prevents you from doing things you consider more important/preferable then it's an addiction.
E.g. If I didn't pay my bills, even though I wanted to and _knew_ it would make my life worse, because I spent it all in the betting shop. That's a gambling addiction. <This message was edited>

That and your not ment to drink the wine at wine tasting events.

25/08/2024, 09:22 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: That's anecdotal.
What she says is the general observations across dating apps.
25/08/2024, 09:26 - Parag-meetup: Guilty as charged
25/08/2024, 09:30 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: There are couple of so called "self improvement" books for men ... to lure a woman to sex... (these are behaviours and psychological tricks) ... one is called "the mystery method"... 
If I'm not mistaken, Andrew Tate  was selling one on this website, and was asked to remove it.

I would assume guys learn these tricks, and then can afford to be assholes. 😄
25/08/2024, 09:48 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: I had this idea of a free dating app that does not have pictures. It matches the profiles based on algorithms.
If the pair decide to chat, to get to know eachother.., they pay per per msg.
This levels the field, somewhat... then request pictures, or just meet up. 

🤓

I do believe that a larger percentage of women are keen on the character, life circumstances, personality, fitness, etc than just looks...

26/08/2024, 06:29 - +44 7751 317418: No, men would go by looks. Women would try to figure out if:
1. The guy is funny but how he describes himself?
2. If he is good socially by howany pics he has with mates and family?
3. If he is financially stable by how he describes his job and living conditions 
4. If he is serious by how he describes what he wants
5. And then will look at his pic
I know quite a number of good looking and successful women who met their partners on line who are nothing to look at but met the profile above.

None of the above would of course apply to a large extent to apps like Tinder which attract a certain type of contingent.
26/08/2024, 11:44 - +353 89 605 0161: <Media omitted>
26/08/2024, 11:48 - +353 89 605 0161: The difference between the apps is quite dramatic.
Tinder was the worst/most looks based I'd say.
Bumble a little bit better but still pretty trash. It had some 24 hour time limit to start convo/first reply so if you weren't on it regularly you'd miss some chats 🤷‍♂

Hinge was great, just a better format for making a profile which made chat easier.
Then just making sure you don't waste your time. If you don't get an actual meetup sorted within 2 days of chat, move on.
26/08/2024, 12:05 - +44 7394 986609: So snake from metal gear solid.
26/08/2024, 12:20 - onur: true
26/08/2024, 12:20 - onur: hinge is filled with old and ugly people
26/08/2024, 12:21 - onur: i use feeld

26/08/2024, 12:25 - +353 89 605 0161: Dunno what that is but I guess every app eventually ends up with those who can't find someone, as may have then happened to hinge, and the new wave of singles starts using a new app 🤷‍♂
The dating app business cycle.
26/08/2024, 12:26 - onur: feeld is more sex focused
26/08/2024, 12:26 - onur: and most of the people are poly in it so idk
26/08/2024, 12:26 - onur: it refreshes itself I guess
26/08/2024, 12:27 - onur: i couldnt get lucky in bumble at all
26/08/2024, 12:27 - +44 7394 986609: Never heard of it. 

I'm trying this free open source dating app called Alovoa. It's OK but needs more people on it. 

Tune in is this odd dating app for linking people with similar music tastes. 

Though I don't care. Its not got bias shadow programmed algorithms weather your a Conservative or whatever.

The filter system actually works 100% of the time.

Well designed too. <This message was edited>
26/08/2024, 12:27 - onur: tinder is the second best imho but too many ads and whores and of girls
26/08/2024, 12:28 - onur: not many people are aware of it and its authentic, perhaps thats why i got extremely lucky
26/08/2024, 12:29 - onur: with a boost u get like 25-30 likes in a day

26/08/2024, 12:32 - +44 7599 430972: You just roll over profiles quicker
26/08/2024, 12:32 - onur: in this one it did for me
26/08/2024, 12:32 - onur: u can give it a go

26/08/2024, 12:37 - +44 7599 430972: I also never understood the humour part. Has anyone ever left a date thinking “wow this person is funny”
26/08/2024, 12:37 - +44 7599 430972: I think what people mean by that is that the person is not thick, i.e. was able to understand a joke
26/08/2024, 12:38 - +44 7394 986609: Don't know if any of you tried OKcupid? 

In its early days used to be great. Talk ,video call and meet with someone everyday.
26/08/2024, 12:55 - +353 89 605 0161: That means you're the funny one

26/08/2024, 18:01 - +44 7751 317418: This refers to physical looks of course. If you look like a hobo, unless you are a tech entrepreneur, you won't get very far😏

women could react like that as well lol

01/09/2024, 07:06 - +44 7751 317418: It just occured to me that as usual in other areas the transitioned men dominate the conversation, apart from when there actual transitioning involved.🤔

It is interesting when there are transitioning debates it is all about young girls not being able to have children and double mastectomies but no one talks about boys deciding to chop off their willies.

While at an older age it is all about trans women dominating women's sports, drug queen hour and sex offenders in toilets.

No one is making noises about which sports teams trans men should join, should there be a "trans king" story hour and are trans men assaulted in men's toilets?

So trans  men effectively need to be first protected when still physically gender women and then ignored... Looks like progressive left follows a very traditional approach here🤔😏

01/09/2024, 09:25 - Parag-meetup: Transitioned men ?
01/09/2024, 09:30 - Parag-meetup: There certainly more talk about boys chopping of willies as compared to mastectomies . It’s a much more serious and permanent surgety . 

Sports is becasue trans men are not contentious at all in sports 

So that’s a completely false narrative
01/09/2024, 09:30 - Parag-meetup: It’s about people being able to be their best and not in mental anguish because of their gender
01/09/2024, 10:41 - +44 7751 317418: Have a look at the number of articles on the subject and how many of them talk about boys. If you give me stats on the number of these being higher than ones re girls I will be happy bro be corrected. As yet every single podcast and article I read was talking largely about girls.

I know perfectly why they talk about women sports being impacted. The question is why the progressives not fighting for space for trans men to compete? I am yet to see a single article on in this but happy to see one shared?

This isn't a false narrative, just because it is outside the box. The whole point of philosophical thinking is to challenge the common narrative 😏
01/09/2024, 10:41 - +44 7751 317418: What is?.... What about all the people who transitioned and now in mental anguish about that?..
01/09/2024, 11:07 - +44 7958 612614: are you asking why progressives are not pushing for trans inclusion in male categories?  trans men are hardly able to challenge men in any sport - no advantage
01/09/2024, 11:15 - +44 7751 317418: I am fully aware but doesn't it mean it leaves tans men athletes unable to compete in any mainstream category? Should they compete in women sports or have one for themselves? Why this doesn't bother anyone who cares about trans rights?...
01/09/2024, 11:16 - Parag-meetup: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6546862/
01/09/2024, 11:18 - +44 7958 612614: i think both trans genders should have their own categories - but if a trans man wants to compete in mens category - as things stand at the moment - that should be fine
01/09/2024, 11:18 - Parag-meetup: I think that’s just what the algorithm directs to you 

Breast recon is a much simpler surgery needing silicon implants , as compared to penis / vaginal surgery , which is obviously much rarer
01/09/2024, 11:19 - Parag-meetup: I just told you why we aren’t talking about Trans men in sports , because it’s not an issue 

They don’t have any advantage and don’t do any better , and therefor have no controversy
01/09/2024, 11:20 - +44 7751 317418: I don't use YouTube or social media algorithms. I go on basis of articles in mainstream media and social and political podcasts from both sides of the divide
01/09/2024, 11:21 - +44 7958 612614: what's the divide - there's no issue with trans men
01/09/2024, 11:28 - +44 7751 317418: The issue is that no one cares about them as their rights are not championed the same way as trans women and a question needs to be asked why
01/09/2024, 11:48 - Parag-meetup: I’m answering you why 

Becasue there is no need for it 

Like there is no need for championing white mens right 
They are no different from any one else’s right and don’t need any special attention becasue of this particular identity

It doesn't matter what he says he wants to do, it's how he plans to do it that would make him a dictator.

He literally says "I won't be a dictator, _except_ on day one."

03/09/2024, 15:27 - +353 89 605 0161: Fair enough.

But he's said this on more than one occasion and is completely unapologetic about it.
When he says it, it gets a cheer from his supporters, when the other side say "he said this" it's fake news...

Look at his own tweets (or whatever they're called in his new platform).

Just wish people would own what they support. <This message was edited>

But those fireworks won't be good for Biden's heart.
03/09/2024, 15:29 - +44 7958 612614: oh, so my main worry should be Biden’s heart and not an entertaining tenure at the White House.

Why don’t they admit that people don’t want their policies - that’s democracy.

He's a American exceptionist.

03/09/2024, 15:40 - +44 7394 986609: At this rate I think they will but depending on how he's term goes maybe not again. 

I don't think a third new party that is not republican nor Democrat is going to get into the Whitehouse anytime soon.

However Americans as a people in my opinion are more individualist then us so Americans as a culture might be more susceptible to egoist characteristics. <This message was edited>

What was your point about people being fed up of politicians lying to them all the time ? 

If that’s a major problem then trump should never get any votes ?
03/09/2024, 15:41 - +44 7958 612614: well, yes - that’s why he’ll have a second go and make sure he installs himself as a dictator (or an autocrat, whatever…)

Nor is crimes 

Or doing stuff
03/09/2024, 15:42 - Parag-meetup: This is centuries old rhetoric which looks good as words but is never true
03/09/2024, 15:43 - +353 89 605 0161: They assume he's telling the truth because who would lie about such things 🤷‍♂ <This message was edited>
03/09/2024, 15:43 - Parag-meetup: No they know he’s lying and don’t care about it
03/09/2024, 15:43 - Parag-meetup: No one is that foolish
03/09/2024, 15:43 - +44 7958 612614: jeez - is there a single person on the planet that believes he’s not a lier???
03/09/2024, 15:46 - +44 7394 986609: Populism. 

It's slow and stupid as a hole. 

The American voting system is not fair across states. 

In a ideal world someone with a character like Donald Trump wouldn't get in but it seems people in America love a underdog celebrity more.

Democracy isn't a smart system. <This message was edited>

03/09/2024, 15:48 - Parag-meetup: Populism does not meet stupidity 

It just means , people overlook issues like lying and long term solutions to easy blaming others and short term solutions
03/09/2024, 15:59 - +44 7394 986609: I agree with your description.

 To me that sounds very close to if not stupidity. Not by exact definition but of the verities of collective short sightedness. 

It's not the most sophisticated nor pinpoint word to use. But I used it none the less.

03/09/2024, 16:02 - Parag-meetup: Ya but not stupid enough to not know that trump lies all the time 

And it’s not stupidity , it’s mainly helplessness , becasue they aren’t doing well and the other govt of the usual politicians haven’t changed anything . 

Mostly it’s them , but they wanna project it on something or someone and it’s human nature / intelligence to vote for change if things aren’t going right
03/09/2024, 16:06 - +44 7958 612614: if a certain short term benefit seems better than a very unlikely long term benefit - people would vote for that.  People even get a kick out of “lock her up” - which is some sort of cruel and crude entertainment

04/09/2024, 14:22 - +91 80720 44735: Democracy is a value, just like Tolerance... Respect for one value doesn't mean you can't bemoan the loss of another value... For example, if people democratically voted to bring back Slavery or Cannibalism, I can't be expected to be happy about it, saying 'This is Democracy! So nothing wrong in any of this!'
04/09/2024, 14:43 - +44 7958 612614: Concept of democracy is so fuc*ed up that any discussion always “raises questions” - a placeholder for unsurmountable contradictions.  If a government elected through a democratic process undermines the democratic values, it can be considered undemocratic in practice, even if it came to power through democratic means.  Nations, containers for democracies, are totally undemocratic institutions/entities.  Nation is all about inequality.  No country adheres totally to democratic values because you can’t make people adopt them - all you can hope for is that you have a democratic election process. <This message was edited>
04/09/2024, 14:45 - +44 7958 612614: Anyway, talking about democracy is as relevant as talking about dinosaurs - it will be soon replaced by something else.  No system that’s auto-destructive can last long
04/09/2024, 14:45 - +91 80720 44735: Totally is a word that can NEVER be applied to any system with masses of people
04/09/2024, 14:46 - +91 80720 44735: You can even say that about the human species- 'No species that is auto-destructive can last long.'   Yet here we are!!! 😎😝
04/09/2024, 14:47 - +44 7958 612614: Well, if the question is does it pass the test or not - the answer is NO.  So no country is democratic in practice.  Feeling better now?
04/09/2024, 14:47 - +44 7958 612614: we’re clearly not self destructive - we’re getting larger all the time.
04/09/2024, 14:48 - +91 80720 44735: I disagree - the problem is Black and White Thinking, which is fine for a WhatsApp group, but the real world is mostly just shades of gray
04/09/2024, 14:48 - +91 80720 44735: Yeah, but so are our nukes
04/09/2024, 14:48 - +44 7958 612614: if you don’t have quantitative tests - you can’t come to any objective conclusions.  In science it’s usually propositional.
04/09/2024, 14:49 - +44 7958 612614: they are just ornaments - only if we manage to go totally extinct - then we’ve succeeded.
04/09/2024, 14:50 - +44 7958 612614: in any case, what are we arguing - we had our last chat, let’s say a year ago, the state of democracy in the world is much worse now than a year ago.  Let’s check in again in a year’s time.
04/09/2024, 14:50 - +91 80720 44735: Quantitative tests are fine, but they're only assigning random values and weightages to insanely complicated, subjective things
04/09/2024, 14:51 - +91 80720 44735: Ornaments - try telling Hiroshima and Nagasaki that
04/09/2024, 14:51 - +44 7958 612614: nobody used them since they were 1st (and only time) used
04/09/2024, 14:51 - +44 7958 612614: if that changes, then we can talk about it - otherwise it’s just hypothethical
04/09/2024, 14:52 - +44 7958 612614: your personal fears and paranoias affect your reasoning
04/09/2024, 14:52 - +91 80720 44735: It's always hypothetical until it's not, just like the  Climate Crisis
04/09/2024, 14:52 - +91 80720 44735: The way yours do about Democracy?
04/09/2024, 14:53 - +44 7958 612614: and there are infinite hypothetical scenarios - not very useful wasting time with each of them
04/09/2024, 14:54 - +44 7958 612614: I’m just observing a clear trend - It’s like watching a rock rolling down the mountain - one thing is certain - it’s not going up, but down
04/09/2024, 14:54 - +91 80720 44735: Agreed, and so is the one about Democracy being doomed
04/09/2024, 14:55 - +91 80720 44735: If you widen the timescale to a hundred years, we are basically just a small dip from the all-time high <This message was edited>
04/09/2024, 14:56 - +44 7958 612614: there’s no way that democracy is not doomed - not because i don’t like it but because it’s broken beyond repair - it’s self-devouring itself.  Vultures can sense that, so a lot of effort will go into toppling it to generate short term benefits - then something new will get built (probably the Chinese model, capitalistic autocracy with socialist overtones)
04/09/2024, 14:57 - +44 7958 612614: or we’ll be dominated by China, and they’ll soft-push their system onto use
04/09/2024, 14:57 - +44 7958 612614: us
04/09/2024, 14:58 - +91 80720 44735: China, whose economy is in shambles? https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/03/business/china-economy-consumption.html
04/09/2024, 15:00 - +44 7958 612614: yep, soon their economy will be the smallest one on the planet.  I really trust the NY times analysis on China.
04/09/2024, 15:01 - Parag-meetup: It is clearly because you don’t like it 

Why is it broken beyond repair ? 
Why is it self devouring ? 

You are stating an opinion as fact  , ignoring all data and history .
04/09/2024, 15:02 - Parag-meetup: Exactly 
China is fast in decline and the problem with autocratic regimes is that there’s no braking it . 
It will take al long long time for a coup to stop the decline

04/09/2024, 15:23 - Parag-meetup: Because it’s not maths 
It’s not even about choosing a leader 
It’s about having accountability and a tug in the other direction if the leaders have moved too far to one side , which is not working
04/09/2024, 15:24 - +44 7394 986609: I'm not saying democracy isn't impossible. 

I'm sharing a video that critiques democracy which I think might all interest you. 

Indeed no systems perfect. 

The UK isn't a complete democracy.
04/09/2024, 15:25 - Parag-meetup: If you look at most big democracies , and zoom out over time , the left and right would have held power almost equally . 

Centering the whole system 

While at the same time moving in one progressive direction of more prosperity and liberalisation .

06/09/2024, 11:37 - +44 7958 612614: Men have been a dominant sex purely because of our physical strength and the lack of wisdom (impulsivity).  On all other fronts - we’re less capable than women.  The best we can do now (given that we don’t need strength and the world needs more wisdom) is to be become more women-like.
06/09/2024, 11:38 - +44 7958 612614: Oh, and now you can’t remember who and  what? 🤣
06/09/2024, 11:40 - +44 7599 430972: It’s not _entirely_ true, but it’s not the reasoning regardless. I don’t think we should change ourselves to adapt to environment, we need to change the environment to adapt to us
06/09/2024, 11:41 - +44 7958 612614: Clarify plz.  Who’s the environment in this case?  Women, physical laws, metaphysics?  What are we changing?

06/09/2024, 11:44 - onur: but its logical
06/09/2024, 11:44 - onur: u just want to make sure that its gonna happen the way you anticipated

There is a good casual meet up Sunday i know at 2pm if your interest? I'll dm it to you.
06/09/2024, 11:49 - +44 7958 612614: well, the summer’s over 😎☀️
06/09/2024, 11:52 - +44 7599 430972: The real question is “what can we change” and there is only one way of finding out
06/09/2024, 11:56 - +44 7958 612614: Before we ask ourselves that question - it’s what’s the motivation behind the change
06/09/2024, 12:02 - +44 7599 430972: Will for Power
06/09/2024, 12:05 - +44 7958 612614: well, as a man, you can’t possibly hope to power 🤣.  No capacity - if you don’t adapt - you won’t survive.  Future favours divine feminine 🧞‍♀️
06/09/2024, 12:06 - +44 7958 612614: is that what incel movement is all about?  ego says - “I can” - reality says “No way”
06/09/2024, 12:06 - +44 7599 430972: Not if my test injections bill comes through
06/09/2024, 12:07 - +44 7958 612614: you forgot about structure relationship agency?  No aggression will be tollerated.
06/09/2024, 12:07 - +44 7599 430972: Up to a point, when we gain volume the dynamic will change
06/09/2024, 12:08 - +44 7958 612614: no, you won’t get any volume - the reason is because the most capable men accept a feminine world - and you guys can’t beat the top men.
06/09/2024, 12:09 - +44 7958 612614: All women need men for is to fulfil their ambitions.  They build circles of men around them (capacity building).
06/09/2024, 12:09 - +44 7599 430972: Sounds like women propaganda

06/09/2024, 12:12 - +44 7958 612614: you could be neutral to it also - just curious
06/09/2024, 12:14 - +44 7599 430972: They why’d you acknowledged it in the first place?
06/09/2024, 12:15 - +44 7958 612614: I’m shedding light on the subject in order to see whether anyone else is thinking about it and can offer insights that I’m not aware of.
06/09/2024, 12:15 - +44 7958 612614: Especially if women feel strongly about it
06/09/2024, 12:15 - +44 7958 612614: The fact that they are all talking about the lack of “real men” - just indicates that the “real men” are getting extinctd
06/09/2024, 12:16 - +44 7599 430972: Isn’t search of knowledge inherently spawned by fear of the world?
06/09/2024, 12:18 - +44 7958 612614: lol, the tone of your sentence is that your assertions is evidently correct.  No, I disagree with reductionist views and narrative fallacies
06/09/2024, 12:20 - onur: <Media omitted>
06/09/2024, 12:22 - +44 7599 430972: You’re free to your opinion, if you come up with some sort of argument I’m free to continue
06/09/2024, 12:25 - +44 7958 612614: There’s an infinite number of theories that one can come up with to speculate about causality after-fact.  You picked one - and at that a single variant.  I could respond by “Isn’t search of knowledge inherently spawned by the excitement of being alive? or  “Isn’t search of knowledge inherently spawned by the need to reach the divine?”  What’s the point?  It’s all meaningless drivel <This message was edited>
06/09/2024, 12:27 - +44 7599 430972: So the reason you brought up feminisation of the world is search for divine?
06/09/2024, 12:27 - +44 7599 430972: Or fear?
06/09/2024, 12:28 - +44 7958 612614: That’s a kind of question you could ask a calculator, but it’s wasted on human beings
06/09/2024, 12:29 - +44 7793 451354: I think it’s interesting that the world could be considered feminine right now. Or is it the case that the dial shifted so far to the masculine side recently, that there is a natural redirection towards the centre now. We are after all, a sexually dimorphic species, and a world that is too much of one or the other is bound to be dysfunctional. For those who have grown up in the previously overly masculine configuration, even a slight shift from the extreme feels “feminine”, even if objectively it isn’t the case. Just a thought
06/09/2024, 12:29 - +44 7599 430972: Just curious on why you brought it up that’s all
06/09/2024, 12:29 - +44 7599 430972: I acknowledge a lot of things in the world but pay no further attention to them
06/09/2024, 12:32 - +44 7958 612614: The direction is undoubtedly feminine.  That is also encapsulated in the need to have a “wiser” world.  We all tend to think that equilibrium or the middle way is what one should be aiming for or what the nature actually does.  That also means being locked in a physical (material) world.  If we accept that there’s more beyond the material world - then we can allow for something that “let’s call it” divinity.  Then you can’t talk about functional/dysfunctional - maybe there’s no harm of going into extremes.  Just a thought.
06/09/2024, 12:34 - +44 7958 612614: because Alex hinted that you thought more masculinity was needed.   So,you clearly feel threatened and pay a lot of attention to it.
06/09/2024, 12:36 - +44 7599 430972: And you wanted to know why?
06/09/2024, 12:36 - +44 7958 612614: I wanted to challenge your position.
06/09/2024, 12:37 - +44 7599 430972: For the sake of?
06/09/2024, 12:37 - +44 7958 612614: stop being paranoid. If you don’t like discussing philosophical subjects - what are you doing here?
06/09/2024, 12:38 - +44 7599 430972: I like it, I take extra pride in ribbing fake nihilists
06/09/2024, 12:38 - +44 7958 612614: This message was deleted
06/09/2024, 12:38 - +44 7958 612614: thanks for sharing.  I’m glad you’re enjoying yourself 🥳
06/09/2024, 12:39 - +44 7793 451354: By its very definition, there is always a harm of going to extremes, because neither men nor women thrive in such settings, and the decline in the last 20-30 years have shown. In Aristotelean terms, it is counter to human flourishing, even if a few people believe they can benefit from such extremes. The masculine (as an archetype) seeks out, dominates, conquers, whilst the feminine nurtures, preserves and integrates. As a species, we need both, even if the scale is tipped on one side or the other, otherwise the trail we’re currently on, leads to scorched earth.
06/09/2024, 12:41 - +353 89 605 0161: What's the risk of too much nurturing, preservation and integration?
Being boring?
Lack of resilience?
06/09/2024, 12:41 - +44 7958 612614: i disagree that you can glean future from the past.  I disagree that there are immutable us as an immutable species.  That’s reductionist way of thinking.  Scorched earth - that sounds like fear mongering.  What we should do is explore and go into paradigms of discomfort.
06/09/2024, 12:44 - +44 7958 612614: but even the characterisation of men as dominant, conquering and women as nurturing and integrating is misleading.  It’s not about what one sex represents - it’s about power dynamics.  I argue that women are stronger, wiser, more motivated, more focused…. and therefore they represent a capacity of a greater order
06/09/2024, 12:45 - +44 7793 451354: And what past would suggest that extremes of masculinity is beneficial to humanity long-term. Mind, I’m not arguing against periodic ebbs and flows. But world wars aside, I’d like to know how this masculine profusion is historically supported.
06/09/2024, 12:46 - +44 7793 451354: Oh, I was purely speaking archetypical, not the specific genders or people. Too much brute force without temperance and diplomacy, has felled civilisations.
06/09/2024, 12:46 - +44 7599 430972: Oh they pay you a lot
06/09/2024, 12:47 - +44 7958 612614: That’s just the statistics of the past…. It’s very good at analysing the past, but not great at predicting the future.
06/09/2024, 12:47 - +44 7958 612614: not enough…
06/09/2024, 12:49 - +44 7793 451354: That is the trap of falling for the problem of prognostication. It’s easy to historiographically fit facts to patterns to form a narrative, but periods of history have had their unique triggers and catalysts.
06/09/2024, 12:50 - +44 7793 451354: Which is to say, I don’t think we’d likely find stats that suggest that extreme masculinity or extreme femininity have been responsible for flourishing or failure
06/09/2024, 12:51 - +44 7958 612614: no, we shouldn’t be looking for stats.  we’re not writing a masters thesis here - so we can think freely.
06/09/2024, 12:52 - +44 7958 612614: OK, a good example that I have is - neuro divergent people
06/09/2024, 12:53 - +44 7958 612614: for centuries everyone thought of them as of “abnormal” mental cripples.  Now we think of them as of “abnormally gifted”.  Normalcy now means “average”.  In the past - normal meant - meeting targets.
06/09/2024, 12:54 - +44 7958 612614: the same with sexes - women qualities were not appreciated because there was power suppression.  Now there isn’t, the lid is off and we’re just observing what’s going on.  No point fear mongering that something bad will happen because the lid was always on - just watch and enjoy the show 😉
06/09/2024, 12:55 - +44 7793 451354: As a neurodivergent person myself, I think the characterisation of neurodivergent people as gifted, is quite flawed, so it seems perhaps the definition is still evolving, one should hope.
06/09/2024, 12:57 - +44 7958 612614: I only work with neuro divergent people - because they are the best for specific applications.  I only socialise with neuro divergent people because they are intellectually stimulating.
06/09/2024, 23:10 - +44 7394 986609: The lowering of male sperms count and testosterone across the globe is by man made causes environmental sciencentific studies pointing so far.

Well timing on both genders between on a more level playing field later 20th century. 

However can it swing the other way? Too feminine? 

Women as far as we know have been around as long as men. 

Has there been much history or social teaching taught on women's role on building civilization being built across history?  

Or where women illiterate much longer then men were so not enough history of women has been recorded apart from other men who did at times.

We wouldn't have families nor civilization without women. We have plenty of history of men doing bad things but do we have the same records for women?
06/09/2024, 23:12 - +44 7394 986609: Is society now going to get a well recorded experience of when femininity going too far on maybe in the future? <This message was edited>

07/09/2024, 05:32 - +44 7958 612614: Interesting thing about social changes is that we, as observers, are not independent of them, but an active participant.  So just noticing this trend and talking about it - we’re actually “fulfilling it”.
It’s a set of factors really - the world not needing anymore that raw, uncontrolled, psychopatic force, men losing their edge and women capitalising on their historical qualities, but also taking on a bit of that drive to run, power, manage.  It’s the feeling of total freedom with its infinite possibilities.  Regarding too much feminine - well, if men all become metrosexual - where will the middle line lie?
07/09/2024, 08:06 - Parag-meetup: Wasn’t much insight in this article
07/09/2024, 10:50 - +44 7516 029853: I guess it should say something along these lines: "companies are earning money on keeping people single and single people start to see it better"
07/09/2024, 10:52 - +44 7516 029853: https://www.wired.com/story/dating-algorithms-filter-bubble/
07/09/2024, 10:58 - +44 7516 029853: the issue isn't that women are repelled by masculinity itself; rather, it’s the specific traits associated with toxic masculinity that are problematic. 
from what I've seen, there's often a frustrating dichotomy: men who embody macho behavior with little regard for others' needs, or men who shy away from masculinity altogether. it’s about addressing and fighting toxic masculine traits, not masculinity as a whole. 
my female friends and I are exhausted by encountering mainly these two extremes, and it's frustrating to see the lack of balanced, self-aware masculinity.
07/09/2024, 11:02 - +44 7516 029853: and it's clear (more often subconsciously) that heterosexual men who lack masculine traits tend to be quite problematic, as their lack of confidence often backfires on the women who date them. this insecurity can manifest in various negative ways, leading to relationship challenges without even feeling the necessary cross-gender exchange. 
confidence and self-assuredness are important aspects of masculinity that should be embraced, not shunned, and when they are absent, it can create an equally unhealthy dynamic. confidence, at the same time, has nothing to do with toxic masculinity
07/09/2024, 11:03 - +44 7958 612614: I’m observing a phenomenon and you’re talking about a wishlist.  These are unrelated.  Toxic masculinity is another phenomenon that confirms the trend towards feminine - it’s a desperate, last ditch attempt to stop the unstoppable.
07/09/2024, 11:05 - +44 7793 451354: A lot to unpack here, but will highlight a couple points. Femininity and masculinity are not static forces. But dynamic forces that counterbalance each other, and switch axis throughout history. 

Einstein’s parents were ashamed of him, because he failed an entrance exam around botany, literature and subjects we’d consider “soft and feminine” today. But in those days, literary excellence was dominated by men, and the height of femininity. Going back further, high heels were worn by men in the French court, as well as makeup and powdered wigs. Now those things are considered feminine.

So asking how we’ll know when femininity goes too far, is flawed, since these archetypes are rarely static nor do they stand alone. They are balancing opposing forces that exist only because it’s opposite exist. The yin and the yang ☯️ 

We only know when one or the other has gone too far, when society is overly dysfunctional and out of balance. It’s kind of like the warning calls we’re having now, in regards to masculinity. There will always be an attempt to re-balance (like we’re seeing now too), because an extreme skewing is by its nature dysfunctional.
07/09/2024, 11:05 - +44 7958 612614: remember, men are there to help women fulfil their ambitions.  That’s why you see the lack of masculine problematic - because you want to have this controlled power.   Men, on the other hand, enjoy taking the foot of the gas and just cruising, trusting that women will take care of everything.  It’s a swap of positions.
07/09/2024, 11:06 - +44 7958 612614: Hence, we have metrosexuals (that you find lacking) and last ditch toxic masculines (that you find problematic)
07/09/2024, 11:06 - +44 7958 612614: So, there are ambitions to fulfil, and the frustration stemming from the lack of capacities
07/09/2024, 11:09 - +44 7516 029853: 🫠
07/09/2024, 11:10 - +44 7516 029853: I am confident I was clear, but my message was twisted. exactly what I was talking about
07/09/2024, 11:11 - +44 7958 612614: Try again, maybe I’ll understand better this time
07/09/2024, 11:15 - +44 7958 612614: @⁨~Cristina I.⁩ “The issue isn't that women are repelled by masculinity itself; rather, it’s the specific traits associated with toxic masculinity that are problematic. “  Of course that you’re not repelled - this whole phenomenon has nothing to do with women themselves…. We’re not here through choice.
07/09/2024, 11:16 - +44 7958 612614: @⁨~Cristina I.⁩ “my female friends and I are exhausted by encountering mainly these two extremes, and it's frustrating to see the lack of balanced, self-aware masculinity.” - this is the bit which is about you needing capacities to fulfil your ambitions.  You don’t want toxic males, alcoholics or druggies who will watch telly all day long.  You have will to power, but you need skilled and willing minions. <This message was edited>

07/09/2024, 11:22 - +44 7793 451354: As it should be. Jk 😂
07/09/2024, 11:22 - +44 7958 612614: I think it was @⁨~Arvind⁩ who challenged me once (he should know better).  He asked if I would date a woman with far right views.  I’m still not sure what political views have to do with being attracted to a woman 🤷
07/09/2024, 11:25 - +44 7599 430972: You’ve missed like 1MM messages from the main chat about how political alignment is tantamount for relationships
07/09/2024, 11:25 - +44 7599 430972: Last months lore
07/09/2024, 11:26 - +44 7958 612614: You know it’s all bullshit, right?
07/09/2024, 11:26 - Parag-meetup: Meh
07/09/2024, 11:26 - +44 7599 430972: Yeah but vox populi claims otherwise
07/09/2024, 11:26 - Parag-meetup: Must be some other reason
07/09/2024, 11:37 - +44 7516 029853: as a teenager, I once dated a far-right guy, mainly because of his looks, but I ended the relationship after realizing his extreme views. a valuable lesson learned through personal experience, indeed. 

I didn't see the conversation you had a month ago on this topic, as I joined recently, but I'm curious to know what was discussed
07/09/2024, 11:38 - +44 7599 430972: In short there was a hypothesis that general populus will drift left as women are predominantly left and guys will have to convert to score
07/09/2024, 11:38 - +44 7516 029853: sounds realistic
07/09/2024, 11:39 - +44 7599 430972: So the political gap between sexes will disappear
07/09/2024, 11:41 - +91 80720 44735: But guys are going Right only because they are unable to score, aka incels, hence I don't see the 'gap disappearing', I see a downward spiral
07/09/2024, 11:41 - +44 7599 430972: Tbf I’m yet to meet rightist incel
07/09/2024, 11:41 - +44 7958 612614: All these theoretical ponderings and algorithmic strategy derivations fall into water when put into practice.  You can’t “succeed” by numbers.
07/09/2024, 11:41 - +44 7599 430972: But that could be just my selection bias
07/09/2024, 11:41 - Parag-meetup: I dated a news anchor once , she’s on GB news now , far right . 

But she was actually quite fun , and not so bizarre in real life . Also had some strong political arguments <This message was edited>
07/09/2024, 11:41 - +91 80720 44735: 'Equality for Women' was fine until they felt threatened by their female boss, and had to fight with higher qualified and smart women for even entry level jobs
07/09/2024, 11:42 - +91 80720 44735: There's a few on here too, if you know where to look 😉
07/09/2024, 11:43 - Parag-meetup: Welcome to this group
07/09/2024, 11:44 - +44 7958 612614: We should start “Hug the incel” campaign here
07/09/2024, 11:44 - Parag-meetup: Well , that doesn’t make sense 
Becasue the once influencing and making rules are pretty much at the top
07/09/2024, 11:44 - +44 7599 430972: I guess it also depends where you draw a divide. Sometimes a minor trivial disagreement is enough to be cast to the other side of the barricade
07/09/2024, 11:44 - Parag-meetup: Depends on how far your right arm reaches
07/09/2024, 11:45 - +44 7958 612614: why the right arm?
07/09/2024, 11:45 - onur: who says literature is feminine
07/09/2024, 11:45 - +44 7599 430972: Because it’s a dominant one
07/09/2024, 11:45 - +91 80720 44735: That's true of media personalities, who are crazy just on camera - remember the whole scandal of how Tucker Carlson called Trump a stupid devil in private texts?
07/09/2024, 11:45 - +91 80720 44735: How he completely hates Trump? lol
07/09/2024, 11:45 - +44 7599 430972: Remember Putin endorsing Kamala 😳🫨
07/09/2024, 11:46 - +44 7958 612614: Bless him, he’s a weird combination of good and stupid
07/09/2024, 11:46 - +91 80720 44735: The only thing 'good' about him is his stupidity, if he was smart, then I'd be scared 🫣
07/09/2024, 11:47 - +44 7958 612614: After watching him on Russel Brand - I don’t think he’s a bad person.  He’s definitely weird and cognitively sub-optimal
07/09/2024, 11:48 - +91 80720 44735: But it is precisely this 'stupid' persona that he projects that lets him get away with anything and everything, like, 'Dictator on Day 1', or 'I like war heroes who don't get caught', etc.
07/09/2024, 11:48 - Parag-meetup: They are too far to the right
07/09/2024, 11:48 - +91 80720 44735: So in that sense, maybe he's smart? 😱
07/09/2024, 11:48 - +44 7958 612614: He’s a journalist - entertainers are allowed to get away with things
07/09/2024, 11:49 - Parag-meetup: I mean tucker is stupid no matter what
07/09/2024, 11:49 - +91 80720 44735: Depends on your definition of 'bad' - @⁨Will-hazzer777⁩ may be a 'good guy', but his "Shoot the 'Boat People'" doesn't tip any scaled on my Good-O-Meter
07/09/2024, 11:49 - Parag-meetup: Why are you watching that !!
07/09/2024, 11:49 - +91 80720 44735: Then Trump's an 'entertainer' too
07/09/2024, 11:50 - onur: yeah, the sad reality of our day... most of the women (especially in london) are "leftist" and support palestine etc without really understanding what is what...

I guess those labels have some connotations with them.

Like if you are a feminist it is automatically assumed that you should support palastine and you gotta be leftist. they are presented as a package in social media
07/09/2024, 11:50 - Parag-meetup: He’s an amazing entertainer
07/09/2024, 11:50 - +91 80720 44735: If you like your entertainment served with a side of bile
07/09/2024, 11:50 - +44 7958 612614: hmmm, it’s a tough one actually.  Maybe a bad person is only the one who doesn’t follow their own morals and values.  I think that @⁨Will-hazzer777⁩ is a good one, under that criteria
07/09/2024, 11:51 - +91 80720 44735: So who's a guy who 'doesn't follow their own morals and values', in your book?
07/09/2024, 11:51 - Parag-meetup: I agree 
But I guess it comes from a place of protecting the weak and persecuted 
Women , black , LGBTQ+ , Palestine all come under that umbrella
07/09/2024, 11:51 - Parag-meetup: As opposed to right where the strong shall survive and weak perish
07/09/2024, 11:51 - onur: yeah that kind of sense
07/09/2024, 11:51 - +91 80720 44735: Like, it's my own 'morals and values' - if I feel like breaking them, I can just change them, and then 'conform to my morals and values!!!' 😯
07/09/2024, 11:51 - +44 7958 612614: Love watching Brand on speed!
07/09/2024, 11:52 - onur: when I am asked, I say I am centrist
07/09/2024, 11:52 - Parag-meetup: No , really 
2016-20 was an amazing time for all news media outlets in America
07/09/2024, 11:52 - Parag-meetup: When is he not ?
07/09/2024, 11:53 - +91 80720 44735: Yeah, easy for you to watch from across the Pond - we had to live through the deaths caused by his incompetence!!! 😛
07/09/2024, 11:53 - +44 7958 612614: that’s what I said - “Brand on Speed”
07/09/2024, 11:53 - Parag-meetup: What they wanna hear is that you are a feminist , or you are not but really rich
07/09/2024, 11:53 - +44 7958 612614: Like Peter the Great
07/09/2024, 11:53 - Parag-meetup: Ya , entertainment 
But it does affect global politics
07/09/2024, 11:54 - onur: nah 🥵
07/09/2024, 11:54 - +44 7958 612614: at least I’m a feminist - I score a point 😎
07/09/2024, 11:55 - Parag-meetup: That’s why you are not single
07/09/2024, 11:55 - Parag-meetup: And with an amazing woman
07/09/2024, 11:55 - +44 7958 612614: Well, you woman is amazing as well!  And I’m not just returning the compliment ❤️
07/09/2024, 11:55 - +44 7958 612614: I hope you tell her that 🙂
07/09/2024, 11:56 - Parag-meetup: We can do that in person we meet next time
07/09/2024, 11:56 - +44 7793 451354: Not me, but society in general. Think about someone going to uni to study English literature, versus one studying Engineering or Comp Sci. The former would be considered the feminine study. Surprisingly, because it has lost its value in a hyper capitalistic, mechanistic society.
07/09/2024, 11:57 - +44 7958 612614: hmmm, it never crossed my mind, even though I can see what you mean…
07/09/2024, 11:58 - +44 7958 612614: Number of books published: In the 1970s, women published three times fewer books than men, but by 2020, women published more books than men. Women now publish more than 50% of new books in the US.
07/09/2024, 11:59 - Parag-meetup: Hello 
, I didn’t notice this message before . Welcome to the discussion 
When you say it’s skewed too much , which side do you mean ? Male of female ?
07/09/2024, 11:59 - Parag-meetup: But almost 90% of fiction book consumers are women
07/09/2024, 11:59 - Parag-meetup: Now
07/09/2024, 12:01 - Parag-meetup: I think it’s an intellectual pursuit ( not very hands on , or masculine ) plus does not have tremendous economyic returns . All those jobs are usually not vied for my males : teachers , nursing , hospitality .
07/09/2024, 12:08 - +44 7958 612614: I’m getting impression that people don’t appreciate the depth of this change in the dynamics between men and women.  Men are facing fundamental existential and meaning crisis and that is manifested not only through the loss of dominance.  

"In the Western world, males die by suicide three to four times more often than do females. This greater male frequency is increased in those over the age of 65. Suicide attempts are between two and four times more frequent among females."   

Look at the above!  Women attempt suicides because they want to live - men actually want to die!
07/09/2024, 12:10 - +44 7958 612614: Maybe when we implement AI systems to actively control the brain chemistry - we’ll see new trends emerging.  As things stand - men are struggling to adapt to new circumstances.
07/09/2024, 12:10 - onur: almost all great writers and poets are men. but this new wave of authors wattpad is heavily used by women
07/09/2024, 12:11 - +91 80720 44735: So are some women, too (sic) - atleast going by suicide attempt rates
07/09/2024, 12:11 - +44 7958 612614: I don’t think one can take that seriously…. Another example of statistics misused to come to wrong conclusions.
07/09/2024, 12:14 - +44 7958 612614: And when we talk about “toxic masculinity” - I think this toxicity is also to be found in the futility of it.  It’s an attempt to regress the human race without being able to regress the environment where that masculinity was needed.  No need to fight it - it will kill itself
07/09/2024, 12:16 - +44 7958 612614: <Media omitted>
07/09/2024, 12:19 - +91 80720 44735: Depends - if we have Civil War because of this, then the environment is 'regressed'?
07/09/2024, 12:21 - Parag-meetup: I think the reason for male suicide is not the changing scenario 
But the inertia in changing to equality 

Men in many parts of society even in the western world bear the burden of the primary provider , dominant partner as a social norm . 

That’s what lets them down , and drives them to suicide . 

Also substance abuse which is more coming in men 

I think those two reasons account for 99% of the reason for difference in suicide rates of men and women
07/09/2024, 12:22 - +44 7958 612614: It might appear to have regressed - but it’s not a comparable regression because other variables are not the same.   Also, the civil war will rid of the toxicity.
07/09/2024, 12:24 - +44 7958 612614: If you thrived in certain circumstances, but unable to cope with the circumstances changing - you’ll experience depression, meaning crisis, frustration, being inadequate… 
Substance abuse is a direct attempt to self-medicate mental problems <This message was edited>
07/09/2024, 12:24 - +91 80720 44735: You're making the opposite case - the social norm of being the 'dominant partner', of 'bearing the burden of primary provider' lets them down, drives them to suicide? And why are they, after centuries of these norms, only feeling it suffocating right now? Because they are unable to live up to that image, because the bar has been raised by successful women - If your woman is an Oxford CS Grad or a Doctor, then you have to be a Surgeon or a really successful entrepreneur if you wanna be 'the primary provider or dominant partner'
07/09/2024, 12:25 - +91 80720 44735: Or just set us back a century, with all its toxicities rising anew
07/09/2024, 12:25 - +44 7958 612614: simply not cutting it - when your ego says you should be able to compete and dominate.  You’re correct.
07/09/2024, 12:26 - +44 7958 612614: no, you can’t set anything back a century…. Maybe theoretically, but you can’t erase people’s memories of possibilities that they experienced
07/09/2024, 12:54 - Will-hazzer777: <Media omitted>
07/09/2024, 15:46 - +44 7793 451354: “Great Writers”, judged by the men of history who were the only ones permittted to publish or the women, who in order to publish, often had to adopt a male pen name? I think it’s a little simplistic to compare high literature to wattpad (whatever that is), and claim that women are all wastpad writers 😂. We can do better than that here, as intellectuals
07/09/2024, 15:50 - +44 7793 451354: Thank you, glad to join. I mean that the most recent period of history has been dominated by extremes of masculinity, which became the guiding principle of all aspects of life. From ruthless individualism, slash and burn ecology, hyper exploitative neo liberalism etc… And this has stressed the system to a point, that people are now seeking a course correction and there is a push back on this direction from those left behind in these systems. My original argument yesterday, is that as we veer a little back from this direction, it will look like feminisation. But we’re nowhere near. Most positions of power and institutions are still controlled by men. It’s just that ordinary men, no longer even benefit from the current configuration, on its own terms and merit. But most men have been told that they should want this system.
07/09/2024, 15:51 - Will-hazzer777: What does feminisation look like?
07/09/2024, 15:54 - +44 7958 612614: much more female assertiveness and then a female dominated world with the system biased that way.  It’s empowerment and normatisation of women as the dominant force
07/09/2024, 15:57 - Will-hazzer777: Women by nature aren't assertive... Unless they're a battle axe, old dragon type of a Babushka like mutti or the iron lady were.
07/09/2024, 15:57 - onur: well there is no oppression since quite a bit of time, i dont see female philosophers sprouting, or poets or chess players
07/09/2024, 15:57 - Will-hazzer777: Or construction workers and road diggers...
07/09/2024, 15:58 - +44 7958 612614: well, you’re probably not spending enough time with women.  The new women are assertive.  They know their value and their strengths…
07/09/2024, 15:58 - Will-hazzer777: They only have words..
07/09/2024, 15:58 - +44 7958 612614: You’re like an echo of a 200 years old voice 🤣
07/09/2024, 15:59 - onur: i mean men and women are into different things, but u need passion to write poems, i dont think women can love like that 😅
07/09/2024, 15:59 - +44 7958 612614: OK, you just believe what you want to believe - we have people who ignore, people who beg for testosterone injections, a full house 😉
07/09/2024, 16:00 - onur: u can nag all u want but all experienced people who have been in and out of relationships know this
07/09/2024, 16:00 - Will-hazzer777: Feminisation literally means nothing gets done, nothing gets built, nothing gets fixed, nothing gets solved and disorder isn't dealt with.
07/09/2024, 16:02 - Will-hazzer777: <Media omitted>
07/09/2024, 16:02 - +44 7958 612614: to an extent.  the inversion is already taking place.
07/09/2024, 16:03 - Will-hazzer777: <Media omitted>
07/09/2024, 16:03 - +44 7958 612614: I mean, that’s why we’re here today discussing it 🤣
07/09/2024, 16:04 - Will-hazzer777: Get the testosterone patches out and the shoulder pads... But still very few if any bricks will get laid.
07/09/2024, 16:05 - +44 7793 451354: Agree with @⁨Will-hazzer777⁩ to an extent, but more to that, it will also look like more men being encouraged into healthier mental states without ridicule and punishment. Societally, we’ll see more sites of cooperation, rather than zero-sum competitions everywhere. Also, with an aging population and declining birth-rates, we’ll see things like the “Care industry”, rise to prominence, and become more decentralised (I.e, not reserved for medical professional and their auxiliaries. Much more. But every system contains the seeds of its own destruction, if it veers to far to the extremes of this. I’ve worked all-female companies in the past, and have caught glimpses of how this type of society could go wrong, if not balanced with masculine forces.
07/09/2024, 16:06 - Will-hazzer777: This is the hope... The truth of the matter is is that there won't be a care industry, there isn't the money to pay for it.
07/09/2024, 16:07 - +44 7958 612614: jeez - women in charge, men working for them - that’s your future pal!  They’ll whip your ass to make money and make it quickly.  Have you never been in a relationship?
07/09/2024, 16:07 - Will-hazzer777: The babyboomers have sorted themselves out, but after they're gone this country is going to the dogs.
07/09/2024, 16:07 - +44 7793 451354: Not at all. Women build and solve problems all the time. In fact, studies have shown that female led hedge-funds out-perform male-led ones. Because success in life isn’t all about action and doing. The female nature considers and counteracts risks. Again, I think you need both. And where it’s only masculinity, you see more risk-taking behaviour that culminates in situations that aren’t ideal
07/09/2024, 16:09 - onur: there is a close link between obsession, risk taking behaviour, curiosity, and passion
07/09/2024, 16:09 - Will-hazzer777: Hedgefunds may be all well and good, that's just moving other people's money around... That's not real work.
07/09/2024, 16:09 - +44 7958 612614: this risk-awereness is connected with wisdom.  Future society will need more of it.  Masculinity will, probably, diminish in absolute terms.  I don’t see any need - it was mainly there because we were competiting for partners, wars… Won’t be needed anymore.
07/09/2024, 16:11 - Will-hazzer777: Masculinity is likely to be on the uptick actually I predict... The age of feminisation is likely over...
07/09/2024, 16:11 - onur: yea, my thinking is females are risk averse thus less passionate thus less curious
07/09/2024, 16:11 - +44 7793 451354: You don’t know any great female philosophers or poets?? Well, that says much about your education than objective reality, Onur. Leave the house more, and dive into either of those fields you mention, and you’ll see plenty of good female examples, and all the more impressive, because they’ve only been allowed to openly practice more recently, compared to their male counterparts. Hell, even ancient times have great Japanese and Greek demale philosophers, juts off the top of my head
07/09/2024, 16:11 - onur: who?
07/09/2024, 16:12 - onur: id like to meet them as well and educate myself
07/09/2024, 16:12 - +44 7793 451354: You’re really asking me to do a Google search for you, with top results?
07/09/2024, 16:12 - onur: u said they were on top of your head <This message was edited>
07/09/2024, 16:12 - Will-hazzer777: Shouldn't need to Google search
07/09/2024, 16:13 - Will-hazzer777: The bins don't get taken out or collected... The shelves don't put up themselves...
07/09/2024, 16:14 - +44 7958 612614: lol, someone should warn the new members that you are baiting now 😜
07/09/2024, 16:14 - +44 7793 451354: You do, if you e intentionally not actually cared to educate yourself on these disciplines or do not have any expertise, meaning you wouldn’t encounter them casually
07/09/2024, 16:15 - +44 7793 451354: Yeah, I’ve got about 50 off the top of my head, but I don’t do free labour 😂.
07/09/2024, 16:15 - Will-hazzer777: No, *you* shouldn't need to... Maybe @⁨onur⁩ the uneducated fellow he is... But you shouldn't have to....

07/09/2024, 16:16 - +44 7793 451354: Yeah, I’m aware. Hard to believe anyone in 2024 actually thinks like that. If they do, somewhat unfortunate 😅
07/09/2024, 16:16 - +44 7958 612614: Hey, just because he’s an uneducated lout doesn’t mean he’s a bad guy 😉
07/09/2024, 16:17 - Will-hazzer777: Never said he was, he's a smashing fellow I tell you!
07/09/2024, 16:17 - +91 80720 44735: Poets?
07/09/2024, 16:17 - +44 7958 612614: well, nothing to do with this being 2024…
07/09/2024, 16:17 - onur: we are discussing philo here since a bit and the only female philosopher that people quoted was Ayn Rand and it was like once or something
07/09/2024, 16:17 - Will-hazzer777: Mmm of a kind...
07/09/2024, 16:18 - +44 7958 612614: You’re forgetting Alissa Zinovievna Rosenbaum
07/09/2024, 16:18 - +44 7793 451354: Any Rand is hardly a philosopher. Not one of calibre anyway. For that, one needs coherence
07/09/2024, 16:18 - Will-hazzer777: <Media omitted>
07/09/2024, 16:19 - onur: i havent read her so i dont know
07/09/2024, 16:19 - Will-hazzer777: Nietzsche eat your heart out...
07/09/2024, 16:20 - Will-hazzer777: Just imagine if Nietzsche and Ayn had a love child.... <This message was edited>
07/09/2024, 16:20 - +44 7958 612614: jesus girls and guys - Ayn Rand was a philosopher… Nietzsche is closely related
07/09/2024, 16:21 - Will-hazzer777: Kissing cousins...
07/09/2024, 16:22 - onur: for some reason, there are relatively more women in phenomenology
07/09/2024, 16:22 - +44 7958 612614: your point?
07/09/2024, 16:23 - onur: i think it is because feminism is explained using phenomenology
07/09/2024, 16:23 - onur: no point, was just thinking out loud
07/09/2024, 16:24 - +44 7958 612614: ?? is phenomenology not part of philosophy?
07/09/2024, 16:24 - onur: it is
07/09/2024, 16:34 - +44 7958 612614: Explain plz.  Does every type of philosophy need coherence?  Ayn Rand was influenced by existentialists (Nietzche and the rest) - and it cares more about individualism, subjectivism, phenomenology - so not necessarily propositional or logical in a traditional sense
07/09/2024, 16:40 - onur: yea it's like the first thing they teach when u study philo in uni (that your work needs to be consistent and coherent)
07/09/2024, 16:43 - +44 7958 612614: Yawn. I suppose Kierkegaard, Sartre, Nietzche were not true philosophers then
07/09/2024, 16:44 - onur: have you read that "why am i so clever?" by nietszche?
07/09/2024, 16:45 - onur: im sure all philosophers had some kind of inconsistencies but their intention and methodology is to be consistent
07/09/2024, 16:52 - +44 7958 612614: no, i’ll give it a try

08/09/2024, 15:43 - +44 7793 451354: Fascinating experiment, I’ve seen this replicated with similar results elsewhere. Ties in to yesterday’s gender discussion. Different strengths and weaknesses

https://www.instagram.com/reel/C_lpLEkCiiL/?igsh=MTZtYWI2eHNnZXpidw==
08/09/2024, 18:32 - +44 7958 612614: exactly - boys useless, wanton destruction…. girls  - worldbuildling
08/09/2024, 18:52 - +44 7793 451354: Not at all. This is obviously focussed on children (and I supposed the severely underdeveloped), so hopefully not directly applicable to adults, per se. But it showed the ways in which different genders met their demise in a primal state, without outside intervention or balance. I’m sure the boys had many adventures, games and fun as well. And with the women, it was the slow spiritual erosion of bullying and exclusion. What got from that, is that both would have benefitted from the others talents.
08/09/2024, 19:08 - +44 7958 612614: Obviously, my comment above was a joke, but do you see bullying, anarchy and the destruction of the habitat as fun and adventure? Maybe “lads will be lads”?
08/09/2024, 19:38 - +44 7516 029853: <Media omitted>
08/09/2024, 20:00 - +44 7793 451354: No, I think the destruction was a by-product of the fun that was had. I.e boisterous games etc. Funnily enough, I think there would have been more bullying on the female side, since the need for conformity and falling in line is critical to the maintenance of order and routine. The is something often overlooked, since bullying from women looks very different and slightly more cerebral than bullying from men. I can often point to bullying attempts from men, it’s blunt and just there. From women, it’s more indirect, with plausible deniability.
08/09/2024, 20:00 - +44 7793 451354: And it requires numbers. It’s rarely an individual endeavour
08/09/2024, 20:18 - +44 7958 612614: just like a murder is a by-product of pulling a trigger.  Funnily enough - you think there would have been more bullying on the female side, only there wasn’t…
08/09/2024, 20:24 - +44 7793 451354: Umm, not supporting the male side at all. I think the destruction speaks for itself, but demonstrates the result of imbalance, even if they had fun along the way. And I think because bullying looks different for women, what we often counts as bullying isn’t often captured. But I’d like to see the study that suggests that bullying was less on that side. That would be interesting. Also, murder is not a by-product of pulling the trigger. If I may get technical, you need mens rea alongside the actus reus 🥸
08/09/2024, 20:31 - +44 7958 612614: We believe in causality - so every behaviour has a reason behind it.  Just because you think it’s the result of “imbalance” makes no difference.  Anti social behaviour, especially a non constructive violence undermines society and makes otherwise compliant members feel like they are stupid for following the rules and the norms.  You keep on bringing up the fun.  A sadist is having a lot of fun torturing their victims.   What difference does that make?
08/09/2024, 20:43 - +44 7793 451354: Oh, I absolutely agree. Not sure we’re in conflict here. I think your initial comment was about boys being useless and wanton. And I replied that this wasn’t my main focus, because they were children, and that destruction was a by-product of the way boys are socialised to play. But the main point, was that each gender has its own strength and weakness, and in isolation, we see how things fall apart with time. I’m not condoning violence and antisocial behaviour. But tying it back to the arguments yesterday, where some people believed that an extremely masculine society would be beneficial. I was trying to show, in a microcosmic way, how this isn’t the case, neither for masculine or feminine. Hope that makes sense?
08/09/2024, 20:53 - +44 7958 612614: If you want to go back to yesterday - my observation was (and still is) that men (obviously, plenty of men who are not like that) don’t have a built-in sense of meaning and purpose, so a woman is the purpose in itself (hence fierce aggressive competitiveness).  Women, on the other hand, have a sense of purpose - which is worldbuilding (with each of the alfa females the centre of their own kingdom).  Women need men to realise their ambitions (purpose).  They are in competition with other women as well, but never a blind and meaningless destructive behaviour.   The sophistication that you’re referring to is pointing at a “higher” purpose.  World based on feministic foundations is fundamentally different than the male centred world.  Men always had that role that I’m describing, but because of the crudeness of the world and unchecked aggression and no structure binds - could do whatever they wanted - destruction or self-destruction.  OK, I’m making all this up as I go, but you get the gist and what I’m trying to say
08/09/2024, 20:56 - +44 7958 612614: When there’s no purpose (woman) and no strong authoritarian, centralistic hierarchy - men descend into a self-indulgent chaos.
08/09/2024, 21:02 - +44 7793 451354: lol, women don’t have a built-in sense of purpose either, we’re just better at creating it as we go, and building communities of people around us. I can see how, on the outside looking in, it looks like we have an innate purpose.
08/09/2024, 21:08 - +44 7958 612614: You just said it.  🙂.  I rest my case.
08/09/2024, 23:57 - Will-hazzer777: Historically women would have had to listen to their biological clocks more... However various pharmaceuticals can help them ignore them. The biological clock which men only hear more faintly was a sense of purpose.
09/09/2024, 08:54 - +44 7958 612614: the sense of purpose the men have is more to do with living up to the predecessors, responsibility of the legacy, the sense of being needed to protect and a hope of being glorified through sacrifice.  It’s constantly looking back for an approval.   Women are looking into the future, not having the same sense of historical care, but more of a concern for keeping the future coming.  I’m rambling, but just re-reading For Whom the Bells Toll  (Hemingway) -  and there’s this clash between Pilar and Pablo (her partner) - where she declares that she’s now in charge of the partisan group because he’s become pathetic and scared of dying.  She humiliates him publicly and he falls into this deep depression because the meaning of life for him was the perpetuation of his own image in his head as of a protector and a leader.  For her, it’s a disgust that someone she’s using to promote her ambitions has become useless for her plans (a ruin and a coward).

09/09/2024, 11:49 - +44 7394 986609: Just caught up to this and possibly causing a domino effect of discussing philosophy/sociology of the sexes instead of posting memes. 😆

But a interesting subject none the less. 

How society applies multiple social experiments and has dedicated people who its there job to think tank how society co-exist together is a great achievement event outside government compared to classical forced methods of conformity. 

Even after the hole of human existence men and women are still learning to live with each other. 

Since women where taught to read,hold conferences and have more free time to join other fields of study outside rasing children they have taught the world in bigger detail how just has important there role in building society then just passing it down generation to generation by demonstrating but in print ,workforce ,society institutions, levels of governance now right all the way to the top.

I have a few hypothesis on women and men. 

One being we knew a lot if not most of the connection and getting things across between men and women for millenniums but it's taken a long time because men and women were too focus on taming outside forces outside of there control which kept them in there more traditional roles until we got better access to materials, building better inventions to impermanent, better sanitation, contractstarnism etc until society reached a level of environment much safer then before had existed.

You could call it or might think the word civilization is best fit for describing this level of achievement. 

Women coming in large numbers this time into all positions of now civilization had a more closer balence representation of the psychological mind set of the human experience which men might of forgot being in charge for so long of ownership, property,industry etc.

Now things are starting to change has women are now owning most of the property and ownership percentages in countries due to high divorce rates and outliving men.

(Metrosexual) Queer men, Tomboys and Trans people can be a outcome of the social changes come about by the male to female environment changes of present civilization. 

Men and women might of reached a point in development where we are both having to look at each other like never before. Could be a reason why gender studies became a thing.

Maybe because the break down of traditional roles of men and women where gonna need to redesign how we both can work together then redlines might be discussed. 

Newer methods if there is one to find might not have enough time and conditions to come out so civil unrest will force things back to familiar roles that had more practical results. 

Similar to a lot of new designs being invented throughout human history.
09/09/2024, 11:49 - +44 7394 986609: Just catching up. Been out all weekend.
09/09/2024, 11:50 - +353 89 605 0161: @⁨~Martin⁩ you gotta get back on the main chat cause your presence here is totally detracting from all the high quality memes we usually have here! <This message was edited>
09/09/2024, 11:52 - onur: yeah memes being shared in general chat and general chat is happening in the meme chat
09/09/2024, 11:52 - onur: its the end of days!!
09/09/2024, 11:54 - onur: one could argue that texts are also memetic information
09/09/2024, 12:05 - +44 7394 986609: I wonder then if the development of civilization has satisfied most of men's and women's basic needs for some time now then are we/ have we or even forgetting what masculinity and femininity is today? 

Trying to develop a humanist experience? 

I did just make this word up now. 

Where both women and men experience is one in the same? 

In language how words are pronounced by men or women in some cultures is important but in English culture today I don't think we care about masculine/feminine pronounctation. 

Not necessarily by gender study theories but removing men and women out of the equation all together? 

Or do we acknowledge or teach separately perspectives from a male and female veiw? 

When you learn a subject here in the UK I've never read a book in education saying "The male and female perspective of science" 

There neutral. 

If that's a good thing or not I don't know yet.
09/09/2024, 12:06 - onur: maybe in the future gender won't be discussed much, most of the people will be bisexual
09/09/2024, 12:06 - +44 7394 986609: That is another hypothesis of mine too. 😆

09/09/2024, 12:23 - +44 7394 986609: This is what I thought recently animtronics will play a role in the future if men and women keep drafting apart from each other.
09/09/2024, 12:25 - onur: I have experienced "genderlessness" before, so I can see how :D
09/09/2024, 12:27 - +44 7793 451354: Interesting perspective. I will agree that men definitely have their focus on legacy and history, namely due to the nature of their fleeting role in reproduction. Women dont have the same uncertainty, I suppose. Not sure this is an innate drive though, since hunter gatherer and primitive agrarian societies were organised very differently to our current one, and the ppreoccupation with male leadership and protection and bloodline is a more recent one in history. Purpose morphs through time.
09/09/2024, 12:32 - +44 7793 451354: You might be on to something here, in that the male and female perspective/ experience has collapsed a little, with less diversity of perspective. I.e, women work 40-hour weeks, lead families, toil and engage in a labour- based existence, just like men. But, I think there are still distinct masculine and feminine perspectives that cannot be collapsed, and are in fact worthy of preserving.

I’m not sure it would be a good thing for these perspectives to collapse altogether, but I think an evolution is needed, to healthier expressions of both. I’m just thinking out loud
09/09/2024, 12:34 - onur: After the rejection of free will, I am sure many people will question their sexuality and gender and what these mean in culture and social life
09/09/2024, 12:36 - +44 7958 612614: I’m not going to speculate about the whys of it - I’m merely stating my observations.  Anyone can engage in post-hoc rationalisations, no way of proving…
09/09/2024, 12:36 - +353 89 605 0161: Why after free will rejection?
09/09/2024, 12:37 - +44 7958 612614: Why would people question sexuality?  Question in what way?
09/09/2024, 12:41 - onur: Many people struggle to genuinely recognize other sexual orientations in today's world. This is partly because we often believe in free will and it is culturally engraved in us that we're responsible for our actions and choices. For instance, many straight people still think being gay is a choice, which prevents them from understanding that some aspects of identity are predetermined, making true empathy difficult to achieve.
09/09/2024, 12:44 - +44 7958 612614: Maybe, it’s just that I cannot relate to that.  I know who I am and I let everyone else be whoever they want to be.  I just wonder whether yours “many people” is a large group or a tiny minority.

09/09/2024, 12:54 - +44 7394 986609: I'm on the search again for more female philosophers again as I haven't found much. 

Only a few in the 19/20/21th century in the west and what used to be apart of the roman empire. 

I did a hole event on Hannah Anerdt on her works of totalitarian  and banality of evil on the Nuremberg Trials.

If you know more that I don't know about do let me know. 👍
09/09/2024, 12:57 - +353 89 605 0161: I'm about to start Simone de Beauvoir's All Men are Mortal

09/09/2024, 13:02 - +44 7394 986609: Indeed I'm gonna end here and get back to memes. 

I just see a topic of interest of mine and go with it. 

Been engaging my attention else where but your all right this one is best for the main chat.

09/09/2024, 15:29 - +44 7793 451354: Don’t quite think that’s how sexuality works. People don’t ask questions about it, if there isn’t a question to begin with. Rather, there might be more people willing to openly question and pursue their true self, in a more accepting society, that’s it. But sexual attraction is primal, and social conventions keep some people repressed or unwilling to explore their peripheral thoughts. May we move to a better society, free will or otherwise.

09/09/2024, 15:55 - +44 7394 986609: Ikr.

In my mind I don't call myself a feminist (The classical terminology) 

nor a masculinist. 

Back n forth thoughts on pitying them or knocking there heads together. 😆

This term humanist I just thought of I'm digging more and more I think about it.
09/09/2024, 15:55 - onur: thanks for letting us know

10/09/2024, 10:18 - +44 7793 451354: Hannah Arendt and Julia Kristeva are also good female philosophers to explore. And for Simone de Beauvoir, I think her best work is ‘The Second Sex’.

11/09/2024, 20:40 - +353 89 605 0161: Watch some of the financial YouTube vids, their pretty funny too.
People with really low skill jobs raking in way over 150k in some cities
11/09/2024, 20:40 - +91 80720 44735: Cops?
11/09/2024, 20:40 - +91 80720 44735: same
11/09/2024, 20:41 - +91 80720 44735: Overtime and all that good stuff
11/09/2024, 20:41 - onur: i mean there might be a small percentage who make above 100k in the usa but regular life middle class means what I said... there might be multiple definitions by multiple economists but i mean they arent bible verses

Median in US is 60k
Median in UK is 35k
11/09/2024, 20:43 - onur: normally there are socio economic status quotas called ses quoatas in research
11/09/2024, 20:43 - onur: what i said was 50-60k lol
11/09/2024, 20:43 - onur: lol
11/09/2024, 20:43 - +91 80720 44735: UK Median is 35k Euros = 50k US
11/09/2024, 20:44 - +353 89 605 0161: Conversion doesn't matter
11/09/2024, 20:44 - onur: so, if someones parents both have bachelors degree, they are like automatically in top 8%
11/09/2024, 20:44 - onur: u guys forget that i do research lol
11/09/2024, 20:44 - +353 89 605 0161: Do you think someone in the UK over 35k is upper class?
11/09/2024, 20:45 - +44 7516 029853: I recently talked with one of my friends from Boston and he said that he now earns 80k (he is a doctor = has a PhD) and it's not even an average salary

11/09/2024, 20:45 - +91 80720 44735: Not necessarily - let's remember that Kamala's father was not present, hence not financially contributing - she was raised by her Single Mom
11/09/2024, 20:45 - onur: it depends, 35 k is london average
11/09/2024, 20:46 - +353 89 605 0161: You don't get US class and you certainly don't get UK class, which is probs less to do with money than US.
11/09/2024, 20:47 - +353 89 605 0161: It's not equally spread by population or income/wealth
11/09/2024, 20:48 - +353 89 605 0161: There is nowhere in the UK someone on 36k is enjoying an upper class lifestyle
11/09/2024, 20:48 - +44 7516 029853: And don't forget about the health system. It's not free
"Health insurance costs $5,040 a year for a bronze Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplace plan for a 40-year-old, based on our analysis."

11/09/2024, 20:49 - +353 89 605 0161: The middle class is the majority of people.
Working class is probably pretty small now.
Upper class is tiny % of people.

11/09/2024, 20:50 - +44 7516 029853: It is, but it doesn't push you into the upper class by default
11/09/2024, 20:51 - onur: i mean these classes are not set in stone there are different definitions
11/09/2024, 20:51 - onur: are we all aware of this?
11/09/2024, 20:51 - onur: 😅
11/09/2024, 20:51 - +353 89 605 0161: Yes it's a product of both, not a max of either.
11/09/2024, 20:52 - onur: yeah and im telling you in 100% of any research she will be classified as upper class
11/09/2024, 20:52 - +44 7516 029853: 🫠
11/09/2024, 20:52 - +353 89 605 0161: Achieving the highest possible education, PhD, doesn't make you upper class if the money doesn't match.
11/09/2024, 20:52 - +91 80720 44735: For research purposes, maybe... But practically?
11/09/2024, 20:52 - +44 7793 451354: Not in Miami or Cali, but definitely in Alabama or Ohio. Just like in London vs rest of the UK
11/09/2024, 20:53 - +91 80720 44735: It's colloquially understood just as a function of how much you make, the neighborhood you live in, the type of car you drive, whether you go to Public school or Private, etc.
11/09/2024, 20:53 - onur: i agree that there could be different definitions
11/09/2024, 20:54 - +353 89 605 0161: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_middle_class_in_the_United_States

Read the profession list for upper middle class.

Both Harris' parents professions
11/09/2024, 20:55 - +353 89 605 0161: Like you say, it isn't very well defined.
But these are very commonly recognised as Upper-middle professions
11/09/2024, 20:56 - +44 7958 612614: i wonder what class would Pharma Bro belong to?
11/09/2024, 20:56 - +44 7793 451354: Upper class in the US is weird, because it is so far off from the middle class. I’d say upper class, as in privately educated, move in society circles, in a country club, starts at around $300k. But there is upper middle-class, which is between $100k - about $250k-ish. The US and Canada don’t have all the other entanglements of class, like the elusive “poshness” and Domesday book names etc. It’s mostly just money
11/09/2024, 20:57 - +353 89 605 0161: €100 would make me rich under the bridge outside my house 🤷‍♂
11/09/2024, 20:59 - onur: <Media omitted>
11/09/2024, 20:59 - +44 7958 612614: it’s a fleeting wealth
11/09/2024, 21:01 - +353 89 605 0161: Are you watching the whole thing through a reaction video? 🤣

Is this the two screens requirement?
11/09/2024, 21:02 - onur: <Media omitted>
11/09/2024, 21:02 - onur: im playing a game in the other screen
11/09/2024, 21:03 - onur: but yeah im watching it with reaction
11/09/2024, 21:03 - onur: its better
11/09/2024, 21:03 - +44 7958 612614: You need to fight that ADHD
11/09/2024, 21:03 - +44 7958 612614: digital detox
11/09/2024, 21:04 - +44 7958 612614: How is DMT for ADHD?
11/09/2024, 21:04 - onur: im scared to do it anymore
11/09/2024, 21:05 - +44 7958 612614: ok, so it’s not good for ADHD
11/09/2024, 21:05 - +353 89 605 0161: If we count Asmongold's tiny screen you've really got three screens on the go...
11/09/2024, 21:05 - +44 7958 612614: did you have a bad trip?
11/09/2024, 21:09 - onur: i did a low dose 3 times i didnt have a good trip in any of those :D
11/09/2024, 21:09 - onur: love him
11/09/2024, 21:09 - onur: he is so weird 😅
11/09/2024, 21:17 - onur: moderation is really good in this debate
11/09/2024, 21:17 - onur: overall much better debate compared to biden vs trump
11/09/2024, 21:21 - +353 89 605 0161: Yeah I thought it was a good one.
Harris was much better prepped for dealing with him than he was with her. 
I don't know for certain why his team is struggling so much with attacking her tbh 🤷‍♂

But these debates are riskier for dems than Trump
11/09/2024, 21:22 - +353 89 605 0161: They can't even get a decent nickname for her.

'Sleepy Joe' was a classic.
11/09/2024, 21:25 - onur: to be fair debate is 50-50
11/09/2024, 21:25 - onur: they are both ok
11/09/2024, 21:28 - onur: I’d like to see [Harris] go down to Washington, D.C., during this debate, because we’re wasting a lot of time,” Trump said. “Let her sign a bill to close up the border.”
“They have the right to do it, they don’t need bills,” he added. “The president of the United States – get him out of bed, you’ll wake him up at four o’clock in the afternoon, you’ll say ‘come on down to the office, let’s sign a bill.’”
11/09/2024, 21:28 - onur: im dyinggggggggggggg
11/09/2024, 21:29 - onur: 😂😂😂
11/09/2024, 21:29 - +44 7958 612614: Harris is already in power.  Not sure what people are hoping for if she wins?  More of the same?
11/09/2024, 21:30 - +44 7958 612614: Politics these days is more about who you don’t want in power
11/09/2024, 21:31 - +353 89 605 0161: What can a Vice do?
She's just an extension of Biden atm.

But she will be more of the same.
Even Trump isn't very different.
He was in 4 years and the place is pretty much as he found it. Just worse.
11/09/2024, 21:34 - +44 7958 612614: Is that an honorary role?
11/09/2024, 21:35 - +44 7958 612614: What are her BIG ideas?  She probably won’t blackmail Europe, China, probably won’t engage in any wall buildling, probably will never exchange Christmas cards with the North Korean guy …
11/09/2024, 21:37 - +44 7958 612614: They say that a good leadership is dragging people where they don’t want to go.  I think that Trump would be a great leader 🤓
11/09/2024, 21:38 - +44 7958 612614: @⁨~Arvind⁩  agrees with me!
11/09/2024, 21:38 - +44 7958 612614: Not to mention @⁨Will-hazzer777⁩
11/09/2024, 21:39 - Will-hazzer777: Agree about what?
11/09/2024, 21:39 - +44 7958 612614: I’ve got a carte blanche with him - he agrees with everything I say
11/09/2024, 21:39 - +91 80720 44735: A great leader for The Project To End The World, yeah, sure

11/09/2024, 21:40 - +44 7958 612614: a bit dramatic?  If anything, current shenanigans with Russia will get us there quicker
11/09/2024, 21:41 - +91 80720 44735: But not doing anything against Putin's plan to resurrect the USSR will also get us there
11/09/2024, 21:41 - +91 80720 44735: So
11/09/2024, 21:42 - +44 7958 612614: I wonder what happens if China decides to start helping Russia properly?
11/09/2024, 21:42 - +91 80720 44735: That'd be perfect! Their economy would crater, and Xi would be replaced
11/09/2024, 21:42 - Will-hazzer777: The end is nigh!
11/09/2024, 21:42 - +91 80720 44735: Forget about US, EU would hear nothing of it

11/09/2024, 21:45 - Will-hazzer777: Hopefully Trump can stop it...
11/09/2024, 21:46 - +353 89 605 0161: Capitulation is one way out of it I suppose 😅
11/09/2024, 21:46 - +44 7958 612614: well, it’s easy to stop the war… You have to favour the strong one and give them more.
11/09/2024, 21:46 - Will-hazzer777: Justice is the advantage of the stronger.
11/09/2024, 21:47 - +44 7958 612614: but, it’s in our interest is to weaken Russia as much as we can…. That’s a valid goal
11/09/2024, 21:47 - Will-hazzer777: If China or Russia were ever to win, they'll make out to the west to be the Nazis this time... <This message was edited>
11/09/2024, 21:47 - +44 7958 612614: the problem is what happens next?  Well, what happens is that R/ussia will spend next 10 years making sure they will win the next war
11/09/2024, 21:48 - +353 89 605 0161: They've already been doing that since Putin came to power so that's only business as usual
11/09/2024, 21:48 - onur: the way they give live fact check is great
11/09/2024, 21:48 - +353 89 605 0161: Only now the EU is pulling the finger out a bit more
11/09/2024, 21:49 - +353 89 605 0161: Largely thanks to Trump 😅
11/09/2024, 21:50 - Will-hazzer777: Yeah I'll be European boys and girls into the meat grinder this time instead of Americans... Value for money...
11/09/2024, 21:50 - Will-hazzer777: And also any Indians that can be forcibly roped in...
11/09/2024, 21:51 - +44 7958 612614: yep, but they are getting useful data now in terms of how inapt they were
11/09/2024, 21:52 - +44 7958 612614: yep, this war is perfect for the States in many ways
11/09/2024, 21:52 - +44 7958 612614: I mean, it’s not too bad for us either, but definitely not good for Europe (Germany in particular)
11/09/2024, 21:59 - +353 89 605 0161: I went to a viking story telling festival the other week (how age creeps up on us) and Iceland doesn't sound too bad...

No one can live every long being a cannibal though there are places in the world who practices from time to time. 

I don't trust stories from "journalists" with no historical information nor interest in the culture they critic.

17/09/2024, 10:56 - +353 89 605 0161: Interesting how this misinfo acts like stepping stones to more misinfo.

The Haiti cannibalism story is believed because, who knows anything about Haiti and sure there's the video. Then we don't follow up on the story because Haiti isn't that relevant to us, the news cycle moves on and we never discover it was false.

So when there's a story of migrants eating pets, it isn't much of a leap and, even without any evidence, other than a 78 year old man saying he "saw it on the TV", it seems plausible.
Some domino effect of plausibility.

Not saying it didn't happen, but it's too readily accepted.

17/09/2024, 14:49 - Will-hazzer777: Acts of unbelievable cruelty are happening throughout Southeast Asia. Every day in Cambodia, Indonesia and Vietnam, pet dogs and cats are stolen from loving families, leaving their owners desperate for their return. The animals are captured and then taken to slaughterhouses and markets to be brutally killed. The dog and cat meat trade also poses serious human health risks as it encourages the spread of rabies and other deadly illnesses.

Its about one false story, which people find easy to believe via the thinking you've just demonstrated, making the next false story more believable.

Cannibalism and other unusual eating habits are just the particular flavour in that example.

Sometimes the rumours are real, sometimes false, sometimes false and to the advantage of the people who are in power or want to be in power and so they're not denied. They're considered useful, whether circulated by themselves or dreamt up organically by others... Urban myths can be useful.

To do what you want to do
You've got to live your life
Do what you want to do

Do what you want
Do what you want to do

Are we all strangers?
Does anyone really care?
Deep down we're all the same
Trying to hide our pain

You think you can never trust another
'Cause they're all out to get ya
We have to live in this world together

If we open up our hearts
Love can finally start
Come on and try, now's the time"

20/09/2024, 09:49 - onur: well to be fair the old twitter wasnt public about the requests
20/09/2024, 09:49 - onur: they were leaked later on
20/09/2024, 09:50 - onur: the alternative of content deleting in turkey is twitter being blocked
20/09/2024, 09:50 - onur: and believe me 387 requests are really nice im surprised its not 38.700
20/09/2024, 09:51 - onur: and i can speak from my experience that there are a lot of pro kurdish or anti erdogan accounts :D so they cant really put a stop to it really
20/09/2024, 10:08 - onur: <Media omitted>
20/09/2024, 10:20 - +353 89 605 0161: Where's your source for that?
Twitter did 6 monthly transparency reports, prior to 2022, which included that info.
Here's a Pre-Musk article with twitter talking about it openly.
https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/1/26/twitter-sees-record-number-of-govt-demands-to-remove-content

Not that it matters.
Old twitter didn't claim to be free speech absolutists so they're not the standard against which Elon's measured. <This message was edited>
20/09/2024, 10:22 - +353 89 605 0161: Yeah. It's debatable which is worse I think.

If he censors this stuff it isn't only censored in Turkey so from a freedom of info perspective is it worse turkey to have no twitter, or for all twitter users to miss out on those perspectives?
20/09/2024, 11:15 - +44 7958 612614: What I really meant is - he’s a threat to the system and dominant systems always respond to threats by censorship.  Most people can be hushed up, including Musk but he’s (almost, maybe?) too big to shut up.  People who are in such comfortable position (wealth, influence, power) and still driven to fight knowing they risk everything are historically important - they are the only ones who can affect changes.  He’s historically a very important figure. <This message was edited>
20/09/2024, 12:02 - +353 89 605 0161: His wealth is a double edged sword.
He's complied with censorship disproportionately from countries he has business interests in so he isn't putting that at risk and he isn't a threat to those systems. And since he's complying with 83% of censorship requests he must not be too big to hush up. 

His starlink and spaceX is interesting. But he hasn't made twitter very different from before. Just poorer.
20/09/2024, 12:20 - onur: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_Files
20/09/2024, 12:20 - +44 7958 612614: he’s allowing more controversial content than before. You article is from May 2023!  So the information would be only valid for the first few months of his ownership.  He concluded the purchase in November 2022 - any changes would have taken effect a couple of months from then…
20/09/2024, 12:23 - +44 7958 612614: But like @⁨onur⁩ mentioned - what would be the point of having Twitter banned in certain countries - he can only conduct his policy within the limits of what’s possible
20/09/2024, 12:25 - +353 89 605 0161: Censorship requests and compliance numbers were already public.
This leaked details but it isn't the case that Twitter wasn't already self-reporting it's compliance figures.
20/09/2024, 12:27 - onur: ok partially reporting then
20/09/2024, 12:27 - onur: lol
20/09/2024, 12:27 - onur: btw i wasnt using twitter before elon musk so i cant really compare, it was too woke for me
20/09/2024, 12:28 - +353 89 605 0161: Fair enough of the article date. Will have to wait any see how it looks in the coming months.

But again, doesn't really matter what old twitter did.
I'm talking about Musks actions vs him self identify as some bastion of free speech.
20/09/2024, 12:30 - onur: yea did you think free is real?
20/09/2024, 12:30 - onur: nothing is truly free in this world
20/09/2024, 12:30 - onur: in fact if something is presented as free its even more suspicious
20/09/2024, 12:31 - onur: 🤣
20/09/2024, 12:31 - onur: btw i didnt claim he was spear heading free speech, martin did so 😅
20/09/2024, 12:32 - onur: i mean he claims he is but yea
20/09/2024, 12:32 - +353 89 605 0161: I said before.
When these things are censored it isn't country specific.
If you censor those posts nobody gets them.

So everyone has to use twitter under Turkey's level of comfort.
20/09/2024, 12:32 - onur: the deleted content is probably pro terrorism or smth dont worry about those
20/09/2024, 12:32 - onur: u arent missing out
20/09/2024, 12:34 - +353 89 605 0161: I don't use twitter so I'm missing it all anyway 😂
20/09/2024, 12:34 - onur: in turkey 2 things are strictly illegal - smearing ataturk + supporting terrorism
20/09/2024, 12:34 - onur: these contents are deleted most of the time
20/09/2024, 12:34 - onur: youtube was banned for 4 years when i was young
20/09/2024, 12:34 - onur: because of a stupid ataturk video
20/09/2024, 12:35 - onur: wikipedia the same
20/09/2024, 12:35 - onur: wikipedia is occupied by pro terrorists :D
20/09/2024, 12:36 - +353 89 605 0161: Meh, some terrorism is more interesting than others

20/09/2024, 12:52 - +44 7958 612614: yes, but if you don’t have any relevant information - what are we talking about?
20/09/2024, 12:53 - +44 7958 612614: he’s an free speech absolutist - but ultimately he can do whatever he can do
20/09/2024, 12:54 - +44 7958 612614: a lot to do with censorship is signalling that you’ll censor something - that dissuades people from even trying.  That “soft” overwhelming power that creates environment where nobody even bothers is the worst type
20/09/2024, 12:54 - +353 89 605 0161: It is relevant.
Your "it takes a few months to take effect" is only a caveat and assumption based on not very much at all but how you reckon twitter probably works.
20/09/2024, 12:55 - +44 7958 612614: i’ll take your word for it 🤣.
20/09/2024, 12:55 - onur: source: trust me bro
20/09/2024, 12:55 - onur: but im serious
20/09/2024, 12:56 - +44 7958 612614: that’s very reassuring 🤣🤣
20/09/2024, 12:57 - +353 89 605 0161: No, he made a choice of censoring the posts rather than having turkey block his platform.
His choices are determined by what he _can_ do, but he still had choices.
He did not choose the free speech absolutism.
20/09/2024, 13:00 - +44 7958 612614: so you’d rather that he endangered people, had them imprisoned or worse?  Free speech absolutism is only viable where it’s viable.  What’s Turkey to do with it???
20/09/2024, 13:01 - +44 7958 612614: His ideology is that everyone should have a right to say whatever they want - he’s not saying - I’ll shine light on these people so they can be quickly rounded and neutralised
20/09/2024, 13:02 - +353 89 605 0161: Turkey's just an example because Onur mentioned them specifically.

What I'd prefer is irrelevant.
You're saying he's a free speech absolutists.
Clearly he isn't. He clearly has lines he's not willing to cross.
Whetever the reason for that doesn't matter, but it also means his free speech approach isn't absolute.
20/09/2024, 13:05 - onur: i mean half of the requests are from turkey
20/09/2024, 13:05 - onur: i didnt mention them specifically 😅
20/09/2024, 13:05 - +353 89 605 0161: Good to see this person looking after their health with a good bottle of red wine 👌

20/09/2024, 13:09 - +353 89 605 0161: Yes and that's you mentioning them specifically I mean.

Wtf does it matter? 😅
20/09/2024, 13:09 - onur: 😑
20/09/2024, 13:53 - +44 7958 612614: Unfair, no man can stand up to your standards…

20/09/2024, 13:56 - +44 7958 612614: The guy who Russians killed was a huge mystery for me.  I’d say something was seriously wrong with him… but he definitely served a purpose…

22/09/2024, 12:05 - onur: its a funny movie
22/09/2024, 12:06 - +44 7958 612614: I don’t know - I didn’t find anything funny in the movie even though the book is a real gem.  As much as I like Johnny Depp as a rogue personality - I don’t think he’s a good actor.  Also, not sure about Terry Gilliam as a director.  The whole movie seemed rushed through and narrated…
22/09/2024, 12:07 - +44 7958 612614: Would love to see someone else have a go at making this movie…
22/09/2024, 12:32 - +44 7394 986609: Was just on that line.

Dunno about Epstein levels, from what's revealed so far anyway. Not as potentially ruinous to the high and mighty either so maybe not quite so interesting.

A major survey of 127,545 American adults found that married men are healthier than men who were never married or whose marriages ended in divorce or widowhood. Men who have marital partners also live longer than men without spouses; men who marry after age 25 get more protection than those who tie the knot at a younger age, and the longer a man stays married, the greater his survival advantage over his unmarried peers"
"Scientists evaluated 3,682 adults over a 10-year period. Even after taking major cardiovascular risk factors such as age, body fat, smoking, blood pressure, diabetes, and cholesterol into account, married men had a 46% lower rate of death than unmarried men"

"Let me sail, let me sail, let me crash upon your shore,
Let me reach, let me beach, far beyond the Yellow Sea.

De de... De de...

Sail away, sail away, sail away
Sail away, sail away, sail away
Sail away, sail away, sail away
Sail away, sail away, sail away"

03/10/2024, 17:10 - Will-hazzer777: "In Anglo-Norman society there existed a myth that reveals a great deal about who we Brits used to think ourselves to be. The tale is that of Albina – eldest of 30 Syrian sisters and our ancient matriarch.

When forced to flee from their tyrannical father, the sisters set sail in a small wooden boat, crossing the sea in search of a new home.

The sisters eventually make land in Britain, which at this time is an uninhabited and unknown land. It is from Albina’s name that the ancient name for Britain – ‘Albion’ is derived."

But they didn't mention that because its an inconvenient part of the myth that gets in the way of it's reuse in the current political arena. <This message was edited>
03/10/2024, 17:30 - Will-hazzer777: Instead they're described are running away from their tyrannical father... Which isn't what happens in the myth.

04/10/2024, 20:13 - +44 7958 612614: I absolutely love it!  That literally means that all women from Afghanistan have a right to get an asylum in the EU!  You see, that’s exactly what i mean by system corruption - the system that has rules which can bring it down is a sick system.

And maybe if they come to the West they will be both gainfully employed and the most effective advocates against radical Islam?....
05/10/2024, 10:03 - Will-hazzer777: No, because they don't work even here, even the ones who were born and brought up here and went to school here.

It's all liberal hopefulness that... Just if only x or y, they'll just become like us.... No, we'll become like them.
05/10/2024, 10:04 - Will-hazzer777: There are only 2 types of Islam. Islam and people who don't practice it properly.
05/10/2024, 11:00 - +44 7751 317418: Which group are you talking about? There isn't a uniform Muslim community in Britain. I know plenty of working Muslim women so I think you referring to a very particular segment of the Muslim society.

The women I am talking about have worked in Afghanistan and would want to work here, instead of languishing at home there. 

They have been largely forsaken by the Western world which created the opportunities for them, which were now have been taken away and I think the West owes, them particularly, the right to live the life US and UK occupying forces promised them and then left the Taliban to destroy .

Thanks for the source...
05/10/2024, 11:19 - Will-hazzer777: Migrant men might be only because they are younger and have fewer health problems on average... When comparing like for like age standardized that'll show quite a different story.
05/10/2024, 11:21 - Will-hazzer777: <Media omitted>
05/10/2024, 11:21 - Will-hazzer777: Agreed, but there are gradients.... More right than wrong for example....
05/10/2024, 11:31 - Parag-meetup: Migrant women is 71% as compared to native women which is 73 percent employed ! 

Comparing the employment obstacles they have it’s a miracle 

Firstly they aren’t allowed to work until their application is cleared , which can take upto 2 years 

This creates a gap in employment which downgrades their prospects 

Enligh is another obstacle 

Most of the foriegn degrees including law bad medicine are not recognised here 

There’s also a cultural resisters to hiring refugees
05/10/2024, 11:31 - Parag-meetup: Even the the percentage of migrant men having a job is 82% as compared or native men which is 78%

05/10/2024, 11:40 - +44 7958 612614: What do you propose - to let the men in but not the women?
05/10/2024, 11:47 - Will-hazzer777: None of them.
05/10/2024, 11:48 - Will-hazzer777: But relative to population?
05/10/2024, 11:48 - Will-hazzer777: This is very misleading as UK is the majority population
05/10/2024, 11:48 - Will-hazzer777: So they would be the majority of the unemployed.
05/10/2024, 11:49 - +44 7958 612614: I think this is the percentage of the UK population that claims…
05/10/2024, 11:49 - +44 7958 612614: so the unemployed EU migrants are less likely to claim than any other group
05/10/2024, 11:49 - +44 7958 612614: and the UK citizens - most
05/10/2024, 11:50 - +44 7958 612614: but again, this whole discussion is not really about that - it’s about the culture wars
05/10/2024, 11:53 - Will-hazzer777: 14 + 22 + 24 + 31 = 91%
05/10/2024, 11:56 - Will-hazzer777: You have to read the name of the statistic... 

"Share of unemployed workers claiming unemployment benefits" 

It is the share of unemployed workers. 8% is unaccounted for.
05/10/2024, 11:56 - Will-hazzer777: 9%
05/10/2024, 12:09 - +44 7958 612614: if that was true - it would have amounted to 100%

05/10/2024, 18:58 - Will-hazzer777: Right I think it is just a poorly labeled bar chart... It should be labeled as a rate.
05/10/2024, 18:59 - Will-hazzer777: It should be "rate of unemployed workers claiming unemployed benefits".
05/10/2024, 19:00 - Will-hazzer777: However it doesn't disclose the unemployment rate by the group.

05/10/2024, 19:11 - +44 7751 317418: Yes they are. 20 years of Western occupation created a whole middle class of educated women who entered the workforce and then there shoved back into Taliban closet. The West has responsibility for their plight
05/10/2024, 19:11 - Will-hazzer777: We should never have gone in to those countries.
05/10/2024, 19:11 - Will-hazzer777: No we don't.

05/10/2024, 20:16 - Will-hazzer777: No idea
05/10/2024, 20:21 - Will-hazzer777: China occupied Tibet, do they owe the Tibetans anything? No

The Japanese occupied Korea, do they owe the Koreans anything? No.

The Israelis occupy Palestine, do they owe the Palestinians anything? No

The list could go on and on... But ultimately nobody owes anything to anyone, the only people who say they owe anything to anyone other than their own people are bleeding heart pseudo-liberals. <This message was edited>
05/10/2024, 20:34 - +353 89 605 0161: What? What's your argument that they don't?
Those aren't obvious counter examples at all. Those are situations where 'owing something' is a much easier conclusion to draw.
05/10/2024, 20:34 - Will-hazzer777: Yeah they don't owe them anything.
05/10/2024, 20:35 - +353 89 605 0161: Why even reply at all 🙄
05/10/2024, 20:35 - Will-hazzer777: Because...
05/10/2024, 20:36 - +353 89 605 0161: Good one.

Why don't you think they owe them anything?

If you crash into someone's car you'd owe them for the damages.
Forget about enforcement for a bit, just the overall idea of "making amends" I mean.
05/10/2024, 20:36 - Will-hazzer777: We don't owe anything to anyone other than our own people, they likewise have similar sentiments.
05/10/2024, 20:37 - +353 89 605 0161: And not the afghan women example either cause I agree that doesn't make much sense
05/10/2024, 20:37 - Will-hazzer777: I don't owe them anything unless they can have it enforced.
05/10/2024, 20:38 - Will-hazzer777: If boot was on other foot, they wouldn't give a fuck.
05/10/2024, 20:39 - Will-hazzer777: Where's Saudi Arabia's owe to the families of the twin towers etc... or Afghanistan's...
05/10/2024, 20:39 - +353 89 605 0161: Irrelevant
05/10/2024, 20:39 - Will-hazzer777: It's a one way street and everyone knows it.
05/10/2024, 20:40 - +353 89 605 0161: It's your 'might is right' shtick again
05/10/2024, 20:41 - +353 89 605 0161: Fair enough
05/10/2024, 20:41 - Will-hazzer777: That's really all that matters in the end... Whoever has the biggest stick.
05/10/2024, 20:41 - Will-hazzer777: If the Nazi's had the biggest stick in WWII we'd be singing a different song.
05/10/2024, 20:42 - +353 89 605 0161: It's just 'is ought' and doesn't get down to anything interesting
05/10/2024, 20:42 - Will-hazzer777: History isn't about who has the moral high ground. Everyone thinks they do.
05/10/2024, 20:46 - +353 89 605 0161: You seem very selective about these things though.

If might is right then why are you complaining about immigration so often?
They have the power to move here and potentially take advantage of something, so they do. Therefore it must be right to do so.

But you evidently don't feel that else you wouldn't resist it or have such an issue with it.
05/10/2024, 20:47 - +353 89 605 0161: But when we're talking about some nation owing another for some potential historical mistreatment, it's back to might is right and nothings owed
05/10/2024, 20:52 - Will-hazzer777: Yes, it is possible so long as it is allowed. Nonetheless, that doesn't mean that the arguments for immigration are correct and that's where the argumentation and disputation comes into play.
05/10/2024, 20:55 - +353 89 605 0161: It isn't just possible, it's right.
Under a might is right thinking anything someone is powerful enough to do is by definition right for them to do.
05/10/2024, 20:55 - +353 89 605 0161: That's not the way you're thinking about it if you think the arguments for immigration are at all relevant
05/10/2024, 20:56 - +353 89 605 0161: But why won't you attempt those same arguments with other issues?
Instead of falling back on a might is right position
05/10/2024, 20:56 - Will-hazzer777: If I am forced to pay taxes to bring in a pay for people who have been brought in against my will and have an interest in turning what I see as my country into something resembling what they left back home, then I'm forced to. There's no two ways about it.

Can I make noises to say I'm unhappy with the situation, yes. Will it do anything? God knows 🤷🏻‍♂️ 

Nonetheless that doesn't mean that the pro-immigration lobbies arguments for immigration are correct whether I'm powerless to stop them or not.
05/10/2024, 20:57 - +353 89 605 0161: Then you do not believe in 'might is right'.
You just employ it for other issues which you don't have the energy to argue for
05/10/2024, 20:57 - Will-hazzer777: Might maybe ultimately right, but the subsidiary argumentation which has nothing to do with might still maybe wrong.
05/10/2024, 20:59 - Will-hazzer777: There's a difference between 

hard power and 
soft power...


When they say "you will own nothing and be happy"

That's a statement combining hard power and soft power.


You will own nothing... That's hard power... But don't give me this "and you will be happy" argument shit.
05/10/2024, 21:01 - Will-hazzer777: "Don't piss down my back and tell me it's raining", cobblers...
05/10/2024, 21:01 - +353 89 605 0161: This sounds more like we're mixing terms when using the word "right".

I mean it in a moral sense not a sense of reflecting reality.

Might is right is a moral statement, not merely a statement of fact about the mighty being able to realise their will. Which is not much of a statement at all.
05/10/2024, 21:02 - Will-hazzer777: There is no moral sense. There's just things people agree with and things that people don't.
05/10/2024, 21:03 - Will-hazzer777: They might be pissing down my back but they're not going to gas light me into making me think it's raining.
05/10/2024, 21:03 - +44 7958 612614: the migrants occupied the UK - do they owe us anything - no
05/10/2024, 21:04 - Will-hazzer777: Might is right, isn't a moral statement. It's a statement to say there's nothing moral about it. It's really a joke statement.
05/10/2024, 21:04 - +44 7958 612614: you really owe them something because there’s an overarching force telling you that you do <This message was edited>
05/10/2024, 21:04 - Will-hazzer777: They don't and in not too distant future they won't.
05/10/2024, 21:05 - Will-hazzer777: Once the cost benefit analysis swings in their favour all bets are off.
05/10/2024, 21:06 - +44 7958 612614: sure, i don’t think we have an argument...
05/10/2024, 21:12 - +353 89 605 0161: No, it is a moral statement.
It's a statement that morality is decided by those with the power to enforce it. Our morality is established by those with the power to do so.
Thats not a contradiction it's just defining it's origin and change-able nature. <This message was edited>
05/10/2024, 21:14 - +353 89 605 0161: If you feel like somebody has done something morally wrong, but nobody has the power to stop them, then it wasn't morally wrong. <This message was edited>
05/10/2024, 21:16 - Will-hazzer777: I think you're thinking of "might makes right"
05/10/2024, 21:17 - Will-hazzer777: "Might is right" is something else.
05/10/2024, 21:18 - +44 7958 612614: yep, might is right means that it defines what is moral - it’s the arbitrar of morality
05/10/2024, 21:19 - Will-hazzer777: It doesn't stop it being morally wrong if the majority of people thought it was wrong. Popular opinion matters in the case of mortality. 

However might is right is an argument which says, morality or popular opinion is of no consequence.
05/10/2024, 21:19 - +353 89 605 0161: They are the same phrase and origin and meaning
05/10/2024, 21:19 - Will-hazzer777: Subtly different actually.
05/10/2024, 21:20 - Will-hazzer777: "might makes right" is the argument that says that those who win the war write the history, rule books, laws and dictate moral code.
05/10/2024, 21:21 - Will-hazzer777: And eventually indoctrinate the next generation into that way of thinking.
05/10/2024, 21:21 - +353 89 605 0161: Nope, they are just different translations of the same underlying idea.

That second paragraph is just a misinterpretation of it which doesn't have much meaning to it and isn't very useful as an idea
05/10/2024, 21:21 - Will-hazzer777: "Might is right" is an argument that cuts through arguments about just wars or acquisition of land. etc." <This message was edited>
05/10/2024, 21:22 - Will-hazzer777: In which case "might is right" isn't what we are talking about.
05/10/2024, 21:23 - +353 89 605 0161: I think I agree there 😅
05/10/2024, 21:24 - +353 89 605 0161: What you attribute to 'might is right', that morality is irrelevant and all that matters is the whims of the powerful, is just a factual statement about what happens.

But is it interesting and worth discussing?
05/10/2024, 21:24 - +353 89 605 0161: I want to know what you think _ought_ to be the case
05/10/2024, 21:24 - Will-hazzer777: Our use of it is just that popular opinion and what most people or a group of people think is of the use of force is of no consequence.
05/10/2024, 21:26 - Will-hazzer777: It is up to a point, essentially where people such as yourself conflate reasons for discussion.

Like you said... Why are you complaining? 

because they're not going to hood wink me into thinking it's raining whilst they piss down my back.

That's why.
05/10/2024, 21:27 - +353 89 605 0161: So if a rephrase. Do you think, just as an example from previous message, Israel ought to owe Palestine anything? Or China Tibet, Japan Korea.
05/10/2024, 21:35 - Will-hazzer777: Do they need to? No. Ought they to? It's up to them.

Are the Palestinians right in thinking that their backs are being pissed on? Yes...

Are they being told it's just rain? Yes

Do they swallow the "it's just raining" narrative, no.

Does the west swallow the "it's raining narrative", yes, but increasingly no.

Is it in their power to stop Israel from pissing in their backs? Time will tell.

Were they morally right to do what they did to civilians? I don't think so.

Were they morally right in doing what they did to Israeli soldiers and military personnel? There's an argument to be made there.
05/10/2024, 21:38 - Will-hazzer777: Does my opinion of what they did to Israeli civilians matter? No. 

Especially when death comes into the picture, there's really no *owing back*. There's nothing that can be done to bring someone back from the grave. <This message was edited>
05/10/2024, 21:40 - Will-hazzer777: You can give back land, you can return stolen property, but you can't bring back the dead or rewind time when it comes to lost years.

"In the UK, 16.06 million women aged 16 and over were in employment in October to December 2023, according to the ONS UK Labour Force Survey. This means that 75,000 more women were employed than in the year before. The female employment rate was 72.1%, down from a record high of 72.4% in December 2019 to February 2020. The male employment rate was 78.1%."

11/10/2024, 10:48 - +44 7516 029853: no way there is a scientific method to measure comparative suffering (and most people suffer, regardless of their gender and age). but here are more important points to consider when arguing:

1) 
The UK maternal mortality rate is now 13·4 per 100,000 maternities, which is much lower than in the developing world but still too high. For 50 years in England and Wales the CEMD has published triennial reports, and since 1985 the Enquiry has covered the whole of the UK. Its latest report, Why Mothers Die 2000–2002, published in November 2004,  includes 106 Direct (due to complications of pregnancy) and 155 Indirect deaths (due to pre-existing conditions made worse by pregnancy).
____

The number of women dying in the UK during or soon after pregnancy has increased to levels not seen since 2003-05, latest figures show.

In 2020-22 there were 13.41 deaths in every 100 000 maternities,1 significantly higher than the maternal death rate of 8.79 deaths per 100 000 in 2017-19 and similar to 2003-05 (13.95 per 100 000).

2) About 91 % of women with children spend at least an hour per day on housework, compared with 30 % of men with children. https://eige.europa.eu/publications-resources/toolkits-guides/gender-equality-index-2021-report/gender-differences-household-chores?language_content_entity=en

3) Women between the ages of 16 and 24 are almost three times as likely (26%) to experience a common mental health issue as males of the same age (9%).10

Women are twice as likely to be diagnosed with anxiety as men.11

25.7% of women and 9.7% of men aged 16 to 24 report having self-harmed at some point in their life

11/10/2024, 11:03 - +44 7516 029853: "Among males, the age-specific rate was highest in those aged 90 years or over (32.1 deaths per 100,000), followed by those aged 45 to 49 (23.0 deaths per 100,000)."

11/10/2024, 11:04 - +44 7958 612614: I’m not disputing figures and I’m not disputing that might be  statistically correct.  All I’m saying is that (if I know what I’m saying myself) all you’re looking at are the figures.  Let’s say that the “real” state didn’t reflect the statistics and was actually much better, let’s say satisfying your expectations.  You’d still be feeling bad about this and describing it emotionally that “the reality is grim”.  Now, let’s say that the stats are much better than the real situation. All of a sudden, you’d be feeling good about the state of the women.  In short, there’s no correlation with the stats, you and the state of women that makes any phenomenological sense.  It’s all in your head.  There are no “collective women” that suffer - there are only individuals that suffer, and because you can’t tap into them empathetically - you construct this body of pain, which doesn’t actually exist.  I know that I can be difficult to understand sometimes...

11/10/2024, 13:38 - onur: A meme (/miːm/ ⓘ; MEEM)[1][2][3] is an idea, behavior, or style that spreads by means of imitation from person to person within a culture and often carries symbolic meaning representing a particular phenomenon or theme.[4] A meme acts as a unit for carrying cultural ideas, symbols, or practices, that can be transmitted from one mind to another through writing, speech, gestures, rituals, or other imitable phenomena with a mimicked theme. Supporters of the concept regard memes as cultural analogues to genes in that they self-replicate, mutate, and respond to selective pressures.[5] In popular language, a meme may refer to an Internet meme, typically an image, that is remixed, copied, and circulated in a shared cultural experience online.
11/10/2024, 13:39 - onur: if this is not a meme idk what a meme is
11/10/2024, 13:41 - +44 7958 612614: would you say it’s a complex cogntive pattern or a mental frame that’s methaphorical and lands itself to communication and transmission?
11/10/2024, 13:42 - onur: at the very least its a shared cultural experience online
11/10/2024, 13:43 - +44 7958 612614: sure, but is it not supposed to be something like an “in joke”.  Not easily understood by the outsiders.  It has a sub-cultural context
11/10/2024, 13:44 - +44 7958 612614: does it not even aim to be meaningless outside a particular  (sub) cultural context?

15/10/2024, 12:34 - +44 7958 612614: challenging status quo?  going where no woman/man’s gone before?  Breaking moulds, inviting controversy
15/10/2024, 12:40 - +44 7958 612614: Unrelated to anything and I’m sure I’ve shared my pet peeve before but … 😜- when you ask a difficult / challenging / provoking … etc.. question in a group/forum of some sort - people usually ignore it, like it doesn’t exist.  But when you ask something that’s common knowledge - all of a sudden there’s a proper heated discussion where people assert their authority on subtle points of  surface level superficialities….
15/10/2024, 12:44 - +353 89 605 0161: The first response to this I thought of was a surface level and superficial one 😂
15/10/2024, 12:48 - +44 7958 612614: come on, share it 😉
15/10/2024, 12:48 - +353 89 605 0161: People don't like to opine on subjects they feel unsure about I would guess, even in a forum where it's specifically requested.

Where as people often have much to say (mostly other people's opinions) on popular talking points because they're popular and have come up alot.
15/10/2024, 12:49 - +353 89 605 0161: I was going to say that if nobody responds then the question can't be very provoking.
And now I did say it...
15/10/2024, 12:51 - +44 7958 612614: when you ask something provoking - it makes people react and reveal their emotions under provocation - most people don’t like exposing that level of insight into themselves
15/10/2024, 12:53 - +44 7958 612614: Wouldn’t you feel ashamed of commenting on stupid posts or piling up likes where there are already a lot of them.  That only says about you - I like what majority likes.  Is authenticity and originality being frowned upon?  LinkedIn is typical of it.
15/10/2024, 12:55 - +353 89 605 0161: There's not much to gain in showing your hand when nobody else has.

As for piling on comments and likes, I've never understood it. Assume it's mostly bots 🤷‍♂

LinkedIn is too unhinged for me.
15/10/2024, 13:06 - +44 7958 612614: Is the story of competition not - look at me, i’m better than everyone else?  I don’t think it’ s bots - it’s engagement through laziness - people can’t be botherred to do their risk analysys - “is this safe to comment on” - so they just comment on what they presume other people have vetted.  The lack of individualism and accountabiiity <This message was edited>
15/10/2024, 13:07 - +353 89 605 0161: Why do you think  it bothers you?
15/10/2024, 13:10 - +44 7958 612614: because i can sense that people are scared to speak their minds, unablej to do sense-making for themselves - so it’s the reflection of the society that we live in.  No intellectualism, no courage, no ideas - even no frustrations.  I think Elon Musk said something along those lines recently (and very controversially) .  I also find that most people are like those side characters in computer games - they just walk around, engage in comfortable interactions and leave no trace behind.
15/10/2024, 13:18 - +44 7958 612614: <Media omitted>
15/10/2024, 13:21 - +44 7516 029853: I personally feel much more comfortable discussing complex subjects in real life, when there is a natural flow to the conversation. Also, I might not engage because I find it too time consuming to properly reply while simultaneously being busy with daily tasks
15/10/2024, 13:25 - +353 89 605 0161: I would agree people are afraid to speak their minds. Understandably.

But wouldn't necessarily think that means they are not sense-making for themselves.
As an easy example, Trump's success. He was mocked and not taken seriously, when he first ran, by press and media.

And yet there's this "shocking" success and rise to power from popular support. Doesn't that hint at people still thinking for themselves, even if silent about it.

They're loud now, but they weren't before.
15/10/2024, 13:30 - +44 7958 612614: Let’s take your first comment a bit further.  “People are afraid to speak their minds.  Understandably”.  Slightly less controversial topic that directly comes out of this would be - Are we free?  People keep on criticising faraway countries for their authoritarianism - again, because they are not afraid, having seen that our own government and the media criticise those.  But, they are reluctant to discuss our freedoms.  What would that be?  Some sort of psychological self-medication?
15/10/2024, 13:34 - +44 7958 612614: Another interesting thing (lol, yet another one) - is people’s take on  systemic corruption.  I often talk to lawyers about this, some interviews etc… but at the end of it is always - “but would we really want to live in a society with low systemic corruption and be like China?”  - so we’re most afraid of a comparison to  something that has nothing to do with us, we know very little about - but least concerned about the system that is designed to make us complain about things wrong we encounter on a daily basis - whether that’s late trains, crime, anti social behaviour, corrupt politics….
15/10/2024, 13:40 - +353 89 605 0161: No, we aren't free in that we are bit free from consequence. Our working definition of freedom (of speech) is only protection for gov prosecution, except for pre defined topics/styles.
But otherwise individuals freedoms are conflicting. If I had total freedom of speech it would require those who hear it to be denied the freedom of responding to it.
15/10/2024, 13:42 - +353 89 605 0161: I think criticising foreign regimes is also a form of reinforcing our values and reminding our own government what we would tolerate.
We openly criticise some authoritarian regimes acts, not because we think this regime will take notice, nor for social validation, but to remind our own regime what our views are. <This message was edited>
15/10/2024, 13:44 - +353 89 605 0161: I suspect they present this false dilemma either through lack of imagination or not wanting to rock the boat of a system which generally works for them.
15/10/2024, 13:45 - +353 89 605 0161: Are we reluctant to discuss our own freedoms?
I thought that came up fairly frequently tbh.
Or is it only in narrow, pre approved ways? <This message was edited>
15/10/2024, 13:48 - +44 7958 612614: yep, consensual and abstract stuff, usually….
15/10/2024, 13:48 - +44 7958 612614: sure, so that brings me to another thing - why do we criticise others?  Is that just for entertainment purposes?
15/10/2024, 13:56 - +353 89 605 0161: It's very useful to criticise others. It validates and reinforces our social norms, when we gossip, and like I said above, let's us signal what we think is acceptable before it actually happens to us.
15/10/2024, 13:58 - +44 7958 612614: What would be our values that others don’t have?  We believe that the western interests should trump all others.  We believe that the the rich donors should be influencing political outcomes.  We believe that we should finance foreign wars.  We believe that human rights and ethical concern only matter when they are working in favour of over-arching ideological principles.  Well, all countries are exactly the same in that respect.
15/10/2024, 13:58 - +353 89 605 0161: I guess it goes in both directions.
We might criticise, say China, to warn the government that we don't want certain approaches, and in turn the government will criticise China to discourage any copy cat behaviour from us.
15/10/2024, 14:12 - +44 7958 612614: we criticise China privately to warn the government, but when we demonstrate in hundreds of thousands - we’re somehow failing to reach through 🤷.
15/10/2024, 17:25 - +44 7599 430972: I think people mainly criticise regimes (if that’s not for money or entertainment) out of mix of fear and jealousy
15/10/2024, 17:27 - +44 7599 430972: Also no one is free from the government anymore, and we’ll be less free from the governments in the future, thus people might entertain themselves with “allowed freedoms”

16/10/2024, 14:36 - +44 7958 612614: In order to feel better about themselves, some people will actively downplay the negatives of their own predicament and amplify those of others.  It’s just a coping mechanism.  Some people, when they get bullied,  try to defend their abusers and making it sound like it’s not a big deal - that’s because they feel shame (internal and external) for not being able to resolve it - the same mechanism works in a whole range of situations
16/10/2024, 14:44 - +353 89 605 0161: Sounds like it's more often a cope for the criticised. 
They can write it off as merely jealousy or fear.

I don't think most criticism of regimes is out of fear or jealousy though.
Israel is getting plenty of criticism from western populations, if perhaps not so much from western govs. What are people afraid or jealous of there?
16/10/2024, 14:46 - +44 7958 612614: why are people afraid of criticising the uncriticisable?  Are you being serious?
16/10/2024, 14:47 - +353 89 605 0161: What?
How did you get that from my question?
16/10/2024, 14:48 - +44 7958 612614: What are people afraid …. they are afraid of criticising and to void that fear - they’ll pretend they are not critical of it at all - but of something else.
16/10/2024, 14:48 - +353 89 605 0161: Israel is uncriticisable? ... It's criticised everywhere constantly.

@⁨~Alex S⁩ said most criticism is out of fear or jealousy.
So does that mean people criticise Israel out of fear and jealousy? If so, what are they afraid and jealous of from Israel? <This message was edited>
16/10/2024, 14:49 - +44 7958 612614: I don’t think your assertion is correct.  People might think of criticising it, but they are not doing it publicly.
16/10/2024, 14:50 - +44 7958 612614: I’ve stopped raising the issue altogether -nobody is willing to engage 😵‍💫
16/10/2024, 14:51 - +353 89 605 0161: I see it every single day on social media.

Norway, Spain and Ireland recognise Palestine's statehood in direct response to gaza invasion. 

It is done publicly all the time.
16/10/2024, 14:52 - +44 7599 430972: Israel? Perhaps because it’s both scary with its advanced and well-equipped military and inducing jealous with good economy and fertility rates
16/10/2024, 14:52 - +353 89 605 0161: Scary here? Are people in the UK and Europe fearful of Israels military?
16/10/2024, 14:53 - +44 7599 430972: You’re not seeing a lot of critique of Bhutan or Venezuela
16/10/2024, 14:53 - +44 7958 612614: it probably depends where you look.  I remember everyone saying that Trump won’t be elected, that Scotland would vote for Independence, that Brexit would be rejected … it’s not an accurate picture.  We all follow the roads of bias confirmation
16/10/2024, 14:53 - +353 89 605 0161: Standing up for Israel is more scary to most people under a certain age...
16/10/2024, 14:53 - +44 7599 430972: If they are not why wouldn’t they intervene and save all the casualties
16/10/2024, 14:54 - +44 7599 430972: Also Israel has a nice side of not retaliating critique. Try publicly shun China and see how well your career goes
16/10/2024, 14:55 - +44 7958 612614: you could lose a job - just like that.  I’ve seen it multiple times!
16/10/2024, 14:55 - +353 89 605 0161: That sounds like fear prevents critique then

16/10/2024, 14:56 - onur: they are printing money
16/10/2024, 14:57 - +44 7958 612614: we need doctors, and I don’t mean bone doctors
16/10/2024, 14:57 - +44 7599 430972: Well yes, that’s why people don’t give a damn about other wars happening right now
16/10/2024, 14:57 - onur: im a witch doctor
16/10/2024, 14:57 - +44 7599 430972: Why Israel is special?
16/10/2024, 14:57 - onur: and you are a spin doctor
16/10/2024, 14:57 - onur: so
16/10/2024, 14:57 - onur: because they claim to be special
16/10/2024, 14:57 - onur: 🤣
16/10/2024, 14:58 - +44 7958 612614: I’m a love doctor
16/10/2024, 14:58 - onur: if you want a legit psychologist its arrangeable
16/10/2024, 14:58 - onur: show me the money
16/10/2024, 14:58 - +44 7599 430972: Or there just a lot of conflicting interest in middle east
16/10/2024, 14:58 - +44 7599 430972: Then source of that critique is just money
16/10/2024, 14:58 - +353 89 605 0161: I was asking why would fear be the driver for critique.
And now you've said that fear keeps people from critique.

You've not stayed on point here at all.
16/10/2024, 14:59 - +44 7599 430972: Well, why would someone critique China or Russia?
16/10/2024, 14:59 - +44 7958 612614: sorry, fear of criticising something makes you criticise something else (that you’re not afraid of criticising)
16/10/2024, 15:00 - +44 7958 612614: so you don’t feel like a scared douche - because you criticsie - it’s only that you don’t dare criticise what you really want to criticise
16/10/2024, 15:00 - +44 7958 612614: that’s the premise here
16/10/2024, 15:00 - +44 7599 430972: Oh yeah I do that all the time
16/10/2024, 15:01 - +44 7958 612614: that’s my boy
16/10/2024, 15:01 - +353 89 605 0161: To signal to their own group that they don't find particular aspects or behaviours of those regimes acceptable. It's an attempt to keep it from spreading. To telegraph your opinion before the reality reaches you. 

You can tie that into fear, but I don't think it's fear from that regime directly but fear of its spread.
16/10/2024, 15:02 - +44 7958 612614: OK, so they are afraid of their own group - that’s the immediate danger - that’s why they are criticising - it’s consistent iwth the theory
16/10/2024, 15:02 - onur: you can tie a lot of things to fear
16/10/2024, 15:03 - +44 7958 612614: yep, even courage is fear in hiding
16/10/2024, 15:04 - +44 7599 430972: But let’s say Kyrgysztan regime is even worse
16/10/2024, 15:04 - +44 7599 430972: Why bbc rarely mentions it
16/10/2024, 15:05 - +353 89 605 0161: Was just typing up something to pre empt this 😅
16/10/2024, 15:05 - +44 7599 430972: Or is it because Russia and China are *real* threats
16/10/2024, 15:05 - +44 7958 612614: @⁨~Alex⁩  - there’s always this potential danger of being sacrificed as a scapegoat - that’s what happens in various guises.  That’s a tribal instinct to try and conform by aligning with teh power (or perceived power) that can directly threaten you.  So you align along the hatred for enemies (my friend’s enemy is my enemy)
16/10/2024, 15:05 - +44 7958 612614: Mimetic theory
16/10/2024, 15:05 - onur: or fear is courage in hiding
16/10/2024, 15:05 - onur: wise words
16/10/2024, 15:05 - +353 89 605 0161: Because there's no risk of, uk for example, trying to emulate Kyrgyzstan.
16/10/2024, 15:05 - +44 7958 612614: amazing - you derived the pure truth out of a half-truth
16/10/2024, 15:06 - onur: thats what i do for living
16/10/2024, 15:06 - +353 89 605 0161: Kyrgyzstan isn't held up as an example of success like China can be
16/10/2024, 15:06 - +44 7958 612614: Alex, you need spiritual guidance 🤣🤣🤣
16/10/2024, 15:06 - +44 7599 430972: 🤔
16/10/2024, 15:06 - +44 7599 430972: And Singapore?
16/10/2024, 15:06 - +353 89 605 0161: I'll try anything once
16/10/2024, 15:06 - +44 7958 612614: are you in the UK?
16/10/2024, 15:07 - onur: 😅
16/10/2024, 15:07 - +353 89 605 0161: 😅 Not currently
16/10/2024, 15:07 - onur: we need a scientific version of those spiritual retreats
16/10/2024, 15:07 - +44 7599 430972: I don’t really buy into ideological threat, although arguably that’s a fear also
16/10/2024, 15:07 - +44 7958 612614: well, we don’t need it - it’s needed because of the red tape
16/10/2024, 15:07 - +44 7599 430972: I think actual military or economy threat what makes people talk
16/10/2024, 15:08 - onur: to allow people to experience psychedelics without the cringe
16/10/2024, 15:08 - +44 7599 430972: Or someone pushing forward big money to make people talk
16/10/2024, 15:08 - +353 89 605 0161: Maybe people wouldn't mind being more like Singapore
16/10/2024, 15:08 - +44 7599 430972: I don’t think there is anti-China PR campaign in UK, I think it’s legitimate fear
16/10/2024, 15:09 - +44 7958 612614: if you have an overwhelming power - that shuts everyone up.  But as soon as there’s a viable challenger with a bit of inertia and traction - that can make people talk.  Obviously, the stupid start talking straight away and they are the first ones to get burnt
16/10/2024, 15:09 - +44 7599 430972: Well it’s nearly identical Kyrgyzstan
16/10/2024, 15:09 - onur: China is a hot air baloon
16/10/2024, 15:09 - +44 7599 430972: China is far, so you can talk freely
16/10/2024, 15:09 - onur: seems big but empty
16/10/2024, 15:09 - +44 7958 612614: It’s totally pointless to criticise China - it’s too big to fall
16/10/2024, 15:09 - +44 7599 430972: However I remember one QC (now KC) signing a letter condemning camps and he got excommunicated from working with any Chinese company
16/10/2024, 15:10 - onur: they are only able to do what they are able to do because asian people are more obedient 😅
16/10/2024, 15:10 - +353 89 605 0161: Is Kyrgyzstan rich?
16/10/2024, 15:10 - +44 7599 430972: Since then other barristers were much more quiet
16/10/2024, 15:10 - +44 7599 430972: Same with Australia and corona
16/10/2024, 15:10 - +44 7599 430972: As a regime
16/10/2024, 15:10 - onur: stop the smear campaign against my turkish bros
16/10/2024, 15:10 - +44 7599 430972: I mean, why do you think people in UK critisize China but praise Singapore
16/10/2024, 15:10 - +353 89 605 0161: Well I don't think thats enough to tempt people.
16/10/2024, 15:11 - +44 7958 612614: people?  you mean general public or government?  General public perceives a sense of consensus from the papers.  governments are guided by interestes and ideology
16/10/2024, 15:14 - +44 7958 612614: “Free media” is the reason why we have the concept of “uni-party” - they ensure that whoever you are in terms of political proposal - you must comply with the basic premise of what the system should look like.    If you read papers in diffrent countries - you’ll be able to see the different filtering of topics (not to mention editorial biases)
16/10/2024, 15:15 - +44 7599 430972: as “we” you mean UK?
16/10/2024, 15:16 - +44 7958 612614: and some other countries.
16/10/2024, 15:17 - +44 7958 612614: that’s why this US election is so interesting - this can be a real anti-establishment government
16/10/2024, 15:17 - +44 7958 612614: and we get to watch how will the pillars of the system react to it and if there are any checks and balances to address a potential move towards authoritarianism
16/10/2024, 15:21 - +44 7599 430972: I find watching UK much more amusing
16/10/2024, 15:22 - +44 7958 612614: nothing amusing - just more of the same same
16/10/2024, 15:22 - +44 7958 612614: uniparty vibes
16/10/2024, 15:47 - +44 7516 029853: been there and was emotionally overwhelmed.

However the struggle and social pressure on you to vibe check you into hesitation can be over time when you become more modded in your beliefs keep you sharp. 

It can be overwhelming if you do not know how to relax and unwind yourself which is a journey in its self to learn how. <This message was edited>

17/10/2024, 15:45 - +353 89 605 0161: It's a good question though, even if it is presumptuous.

If their parents really are in that kind of financial position, why don't they help them out?
What's the difference in thinking between them?
17/10/2024, 16:03 - +44 7958 612614: Helping out is problematic.  Who needs helping?  When does one need help?  What will helping someone do something lead to?  If I see a bird that’s fallen out of its nest - that looks to me like help is needed.  When. someone is in an immediate mortal danger or being hurt or killed?  But even then - it’s my subjective opinion whether I should offer help.  Now, being at the receiving end and faulting someone for nnot helping you in a situation that’s not a life and death situation indicates some sort of entitlement.  But, if you consider that you need help and you’re unwilling to take it by force - your position is not the one of entitlement (maybe moral entitlement?? - which is a joke)
17/10/2024, 16:04 - onur: I get this point of view but sounds too much for me
17/10/2024, 16:05 - onur: there should be a healthy communication among friends, family or lovers if someone feels like they need help
17/10/2024, 16:05 - onur: given that I dont have family or friends, I am not sure how much weight do my words hold
17/10/2024, 16:06 - +44 7958 612614: Since when making someone more comfortable should be the threshold for rendering help?  I want a more comfortable sofa, but can’t afford it - help!  I want a better sounding hifi, I’d like tastier beef.  I want to pull better looking women…. HELP!
17/10/2024, 16:07 - +44 7958 612614: What happened to that childhood friend you once told me about?

18/10/2024, 20:19 - +44 7394 986609: Perhaps the human race is split onto personality types and cognitive ability.

They find it hard to get along however there are always ideas on how to keep things more balanced  but not always moral. 

Aiming towards what can keep somthing close to balanced should be a aim but this might be a unachievable goal, hard to visualise and a engine that will always need maintenance. 

Living with that possible reality I don't know if all human minds can handle emotionally. 

Too including myself at this point in time and unsure if ever.

Thinking of this makes me wonder if people choosing a pre-existing belief system or tribe in prison to cope even if it is against the grain is not that irrational. <This message was edited>

23/10/2024, 18:24 - +353 89 605 0161: I have the inkling of a theory there's some sort of U shaped approval/indifference-exposure graph between groups of people.

Very low exposure, high approval/indifference.
Moderate exposure, low approval.
High exposure, high approval.

Haven't fleshed it out yet but meaning to look into it from my own experience.

I was a lot more sympathetic to some demographics before I met them than I am now 😅
But others I speak to with closer contact with them have the same opinions I used to have (or more accurately the opinions I adopted)
23/10/2024, 18:26 - onur: the duration and the frequency of the exposure also matters 😅
23/10/2024, 18:33 - +353 89 605 0161: Dunno why I'm being coy there.

Drug addicts.
When I lived in London I had zero contact with addicts and had, what I'd describe as, "sympathetic" views.

Where I'm living at the moment over looks a spot in the city where they regularly deal and inject.
I WFH few days a week and see them every day that I do. I won't sugar coat it, makes it hard to see their humanity. When you're seeing them almost daily wander zombie-like into an alley, shoot up, passing out, taking a dump on the pavement...
Anyway, then I talk with people who work in social care and work with addicts, and they've obviously seeing the human side of these people more and their opinions reflect that I think.

So I was low exposure, now mid exposure and it's dropped. Would it climb if I started working in social care for example?

23/10/2024, 19:49 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: It's a very specific example.
Your U-shape (of people exposure to acceptance), have vast deviations, depending on variables, like impact on your circumstances, impact on regional economy/environment, who's in power, etc etc. 

The u-shape is generally applicable on small scales, but will rapidly deteriorate with increasing complexity of the system. <This message was edited>
23/10/2024, 19:56 - +353 89 605 0161: I guess it depends how many deviations to whether it'd be an accurate enough model to be useful at all.

I chose the specific example just cause it's my own, but it seems there a general trend of groups who don't integrate much (even if they still just keep themselves to themselves) experiencing a lot of animosity. By not integrating they'd be on the native populations mid exposure range.
But by keeping to themselves they're having very low impact.
23/10/2024, 19:57 - +353 89 605 0161: I group having high impact illiciting strong feelings from others hardly needs explanation
23/10/2024, 20:07 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: True, it's a game of power position. 

South Africa apartheid.
Australian aborigines.
Spanish conquistadors.
 ...some of the big U-curve deviations.

Small scale, (nearly) perfect U-shapes, ... some Asian communities, Hispanics in Spain.

28/10/2024, 15:35 - +44 7958 612614: how’s journalism= liberalism?  Liberalism stands for individual freedoms, including freedom of speech.  Journalists must comply with whatever the owners/editor of the media tell them.

28/10/2024, 15:39 - Will-hazzer777: The government can only curtail speech, not make it freer. Best well to leave the government out of it if they really believe in democracy and classical liberal values, but I very much doubt it.

28/10/2024, 15:41 - Will-hazzer777: That's not what I meant, when I said they don't mean democracy, they mean liberalism.
28/10/2024, 15:42 - +44 7958 612614: OK, so do we agree that our press is not liberal?  Meaning - they don’t blindly follow liberal ideas - justice, ethics, accountability, transparency, non-bias, freedom of speech ?
28/10/2024, 15:43 - Will-hazzer777: It's definitely not in favour of classical liberal values, correct.
28/10/2024, 15:44 - +44 7958 612614: if so - that press is not liberal - it’s part of the system - in fact quite similar to Russia or China except that it’s run from several organisationally independent headquarters
28/10/2024, 15:50 - Will-hazzer777: Well it's not really surprising that lots of ex politicians end up working high in in these media organisations because they're not really independent.

28/10/2024, 15:54 - Will-hazzer777: When liberals talk about democracy they don't mean democracy, they mean their particular order.
28/10/2024, 15:55 - Will-hazzer777: And saying the government must intervene in journalism goes to prove it.

28/10/2024, 16:18 - Will-hazzer777: Well that's besides the point. The headline shows it's own inherent contradiction. It tries to get those who are classical liberals to think that government intervention in journalism will preserve democracy, clearly the contrary to what classical liberals think i.e. that a true democracy cannot be run without freedom of the press, which involves removing government intervention not more of it.

All it can lead me to think is this person is trying to hoodwink numbskulls in doing the whole switcheroo, i.e. replacing the term contemporary leftwing values with democracy, which are inherently at loggerheads with eachother.
28/10/2024, 16:19 - Will-hazzer777: Not much all and especially no government funded media organisations.

02/11/2024, 19:21 - +353 89 605 0161: Labour gov might be born out of trade unions but I'm not sure I understand why we'd expect to see an end to strikes when they're in power.

They've clearly drifted from union affiliation over the decades anyway, but even if they _were_ a pro union party. Why wouldn't there still be strikes? <This message was edited>
02/11/2024, 19:22 - +353 89 605 0161: Plus, strikes are legit part of the negotiations, even if undesirable for both sides.
02/11/2024, 20:47 - +44 7599 430972: Thanks!
02/11/2024, 21:16 - +353 89 605 0161: Anytime mate.
The answer is "cause why wouldn't there be" 👍
02/11/2024, 21:16 - +44 7599 430972: Nah I just needed someone to acknowledge that Labour had drifted away from their name
02/11/2024, 21:17 - +44 7599 430972: Which is not unusual, commies also started as pro-proletarian before massacres of factory workers
02/11/2024, 21:36 - +353 89 605 0161: Shouldn't think that'd be hard 😅
02/11/2024, 21:37 - +353 89 605 0161: But would you expect no strikes under a _true_ Labour gov?
I would only expect, perhaps, no forceful police crack downs.
But pro union parties are still going to disagree individual cases.

Just like individual union members disagree on strike action. <This message was edited>
02/11/2024, 21:43 - +44 7599 430972: Ofc, there still be strikes in private enterprises, although I believe the Labour government would crack down on business that mistreat or underpay their workers (or at least will make it one of their top priorities)

06/11/2024, 11:19 - +44 7599 430972: Which setbacks were exclusive to Europe?
06/11/2024, 11:21 - Will-hazzer777: <Media omitted>
06/11/2024, 11:22 - +44 7516 029853: Europe must control russia to avoid future outbreaks of war, but it is clearly culturally too far away. 
you even have a russian liberal making jokes about the president of a country that has been attacked and split by war countless times by his home country. 
again, this is an example of a relatively sane liberal, which is not the majority. <This message was edited>
06/11/2024, 11:23 - Will-hazzer777: Yes really... Especially eastern Europe... I'm quite certain east Germany is starting to think they chose the wrong side of the Berlin wall to take down...
06/11/2024, 11:23 - +44 7958 612614: nope, not at all
06/11/2024, 11:24 - +44 7516 029853: the fact that they clearly become more right leaning doesn't mean they want to be back in the ussr
06/11/2024, 11:24 - Will-hazzer777: Well that's what Napoleon and Hitler thought too... But it'll be very much the other way around.... We have no resources in Europe.
06/11/2024, 11:25 - +44 7958 612614: but I’m just thinking about Plato that we discussed the other day - and I found “descending into anarchy” troublesome - but actually, maybe that’s the exact reason why autocracy is necessary.  And even democracy is a dictatorship (but a shitty one)
06/11/2024, 11:25 - Will-hazzer777: I think when they know the oil and gas that was being streamed to them have stopped arriving, I think they'll say it would be a price worth paying to get it back!
06/11/2024, 11:26 - +44 7516 029853: how come? look at stats
"The European Union's GDP is estimated to be $19.40 trillion (nominal) in 2024 or $28.04 trillion (PPP), representing around one-sixth of the global economy. Germany has the biggest national GDP of all EU countries, followed by France and Italy."
06/11/2024, 11:26 - +44 7516 029853: second largest after the US, also being just under 6% of the population
06/11/2024, 11:26 - +44 7599 430972: Check in PPP
06/11/2024, 11:26 - +44 7516 029853: and the stats doesn't include the UK :(
06/11/2024, 11:26 - +44 7599 430972: Or 10 year projections of the gross one
06/11/2024, 11:26 - Will-hazzer777: If you hadn't noticed, Germany's economy is going down the pan.
06/11/2024, 11:32 - +44 7516 029853: still relatively strong
06/11/2024, 11:33 - +44 7958 612614: it will (I fuckng hope) recover when they get a proper government in.  F**** losers
06/11/2024, 11:34 - Will-hazzer777: And where are they going to get the cheap gas to fire up their manufacturing base again?
06/11/2024, 11:35 - +44 7516 029853: you don't need gas
06/11/2024, 11:35 - +44 7516 029853: it's outdated and too dangerous to rely on it as we can see
06/11/2024, 11:37 - +44 7958 612614: RUSSIA
06/11/2024, 11:39 - +44 7516 029853: is a terrorist state
06/11/2024, 11:39 - +44 7599 430972: You have an alternative source in mind?
06/11/2024, 11:39 - +44 7793 451354: Oof, looks like Trump took the majority. Control of house and senate.
06/11/2024, 11:39 - +44 7516 029853: green energy which includes nuclear power stations
06/11/2024, 11:39 - +44 7599 430972: The ones Germany have closed?
06/11/2024, 11:40 - +44 7516 029853: utterly stupid, yes
06/11/2024, 11:40 - +44 7958 612614: that’s just like a marketing term.  It really has no meaning calling a country “?terrorist”.
06/11/2024, 11:40 - +44 7516 029853: seriously?
06/11/2024, 11:41 - +44 7958 612614: honestly, just like democracy is a made up thing for nothing - literally fluff as @⁨Will-hazzer777⁩ would say
06/11/2024, 11:41 - +44 7516 029853: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_war_crimes
06/11/2024, 11:41 - +44 7599 430972: everybody are so smart in hindsight…
06/11/2024, 11:42 - +44 7958 612614: thinkers don’t react to visual prompts and change their stance on a dime
06/11/2024, 11:42 - +44 7516 029853: according to the legal definition of the word "genocide", russia commits genocide in Ukraine
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocide
06/11/2024, 11:43 - +44 7599 430972: So did Brits towards India
06/11/2024, 11:43 - +44 7599 430972: Let’s punish people chronologically
06/11/2024, 11:43 - +44 7516 029853: it was clearly a huge move back even when it was happening, it was in contradiction to many other European countries, including France
06/11/2024, 11:44 - +44 7516 029853: Brits are not committing genocide towards India at the moment
06/11/2024, 11:44 - +44 7958 612614: you seem overly sensitive to manipulative propaganda. - if you want to look for genocide - there’s a real one going on as we speak
06/11/2024, 11:45 - +44 7599 430972: They sponsor Israel tho
06/11/2024, 11:45 - +44 7958 612614: it’s actually really not OK to call what’s going on in Ukraine a genocide (even though it’s horrible enough and wrong)
06/11/2024, 11:46 - +44 7516 029853: it's actually exactly how it should be called and the rejection of that fact poses many dangers
06/11/2024, 11:46 - +44 7516 029853: including having economic ties with dangerous countries and closing Nuclear stations hoping that cheap gas will flow forever
06/11/2024, 11:47 - +44 7516 029853: that putting aside the moral side
06/11/2024, 11:47 - +44 7958 612614: ties with dangerous countries???  what kind of brain washing is that?  So there are good and bad countries?
06/11/2024, 11:47 - +44 7516 029853: as morally many genuinely do not care about human rights
06/11/2024, 11:47 - +44 7958 612614: I care
06/11/2024, 11:48 - +44 7516 029853: clearly not. 
but I will share more info about dangerous ties
06/11/2024, 11:48 - +44 7599 430972: How did you figure that he is not? Do you need a care license?

06/11/2024, 11:49 - Parag-meetup: Let’s first stop from more of it happening
06/11/2024, 11:49 - +44 7599 430972: Check France, they also still selling actual guns and optics to Russia
06/11/2024, 11:49 - +44 7599 430972: Agreed
06/11/2024, 11:57 - onur: lol
06/11/2024, 12:22 - Will-hazzer777: They don't exist... They're made up nonsense on stilts. Well meaning nonsense perhaps, but still nonsense.
06/11/2024, 12:23 - +44 7958 612614: just because it’s meaningless and made-up nonsense - it doesn’t meean we don’t care 🤓
06/11/2024, 12:24 - +44 7958 612614: it’s nice to care even for things you know don’t exist 😉
06/11/2024, 12:25 - Will-hazzer777: I actually don't apply that to democracy, democracy is something more substantial, but it requires certain types of people to make it work. Other types of people are not naturally inclined to democracy due to their collective natures...  The west won't be in a few decades due to mass immigration... Democracy won't survive the cultural change.
06/11/2024, 12:26 - Will-hazzer777: "Be kind" my friend ✌️☮️
06/11/2024, 12:26 - +44 7958 612614: democracy is a made-up need, its importance is inflated - human rights is at least linked to some ethics.  Oh, please, don’t get me started on democracy - it’s pure marketing
06/11/2024, 12:27 - Will-hazzer777: Democracy is a process... Human rights are a wish list with no means of enforcement. Might is right in the end.
06/11/2024, 12:29 - +44 7958 612614: Democracy is like a fruit.  Any fruit.  Human rights is like an idea and a concept.  Might is right in the end.
06/11/2024, 12:29 - Will-hazzer777: For democracy and human rights to function they require certain types of people with particular natural dispositions. Other people cannot and will not adopt them except in a sham way and once they do not need to play act anymore they'll drop their masks quite readily.
06/11/2024, 12:30 - Will-hazzer777: Might is right! ✊

Might is right! ✊

Might is right! ✊
06/11/2024, 12:31 - +44 7958 612614: So concept of human rights is a noble concept - but it’s not anything real.  Democracy is just one way of organising people - nothing special.  It’s just some common sense methodology that sometimes works
06/11/2024, 12:32 - Will-hazzer777: It's only noble if you think that it's noble... Genghis Khan wouldn't have considered human rights noble... <This message was edited>
06/11/2024, 12:36 - Will-hazzer777: Human rights are essentially a post-christian ethical framework imposed upon the world by the winners of the second world war. The originators of the list hated eachother, which isn't a great start.

This moral framework only really chimes with post-christian parts of the world, and so are just a product of their time and place and the cultural milieu that they were created in.
06/11/2024, 12:39 - +44 7958 612614: exactlhy, it’s only there so we can say that we have noble thoughts
06/11/2024, 12:39 - onur: i think u are confusing political liberalism and economical
06/11/2024, 12:39 - onur: :D

06/11/2024, 12:41 - onur: lol
06/11/2024, 12:41 - onur: sorry guys
06/11/2024, 12:42 - +44 7958 612614: we’ve already defined it - it’s great, right?
06/11/2024, 12:43 - Will-hazzer777: They won't survive the islamification of Europe.
06/11/2024, 12:44 - Will-hazzer777: Democracy nor human rights.
06/11/2024, 12:45 - Will-hazzer777: The post-Christians can say "we can convert them"... Well that's just the Christian in you talking.
06/11/2024, 12:46 - +44 7599 430972: Is there anything wrong with Christianity?
06/11/2024, 12:48 - onur: yes there is
06/11/2024, 12:48 - +44 7599 430972: Name 3 things
06/11/2024, 12:49 - +353 89 605 0161: Son, father, holy spirit

06/11/2024, 12:55 - Will-hazzer777: It has mutated into some kind of Disneyland version of itself...
06/11/2024, 12:55 - onur: okay nobody claimed nothing is wrong about this chat
06/11/2024, 12:55 - +44 7599 430972: I just did
06/11/2024, 12:55 - onur: double negative there
06/11/2024, 12:55 - onur: :D
06/11/2024, 12:56 - +44 7958 612614: lol, the islamification of Europe is so far down the list of threats.  As a force (cognitive, organisational, military) - they are absolutely useless
06/11/2024, 12:56 - Will-hazzer777: Ummm not with these birth rates they aren't.
06/11/2024, 12:57 - +44 7599 430972: I mean Mormon's birth rates are fine
06/11/2024, 12:57 - Parag-meetup: Agree
06/11/2024, 12:57 - +44 7599 430972: Also in Israel
06/11/2024, 12:57 - +353 89 605 0161: It fucked it early on.
Letting gentiles be Christians, bad shout.
06/11/2024, 12:58 - Will-hazzer777: Well, it needed to expand, otherwise probably Judaism would be Christianity today and most of the world would be worshiping Thor and Wotan instead.
06/11/2024, 12:59 - onur: you will realize when its too late I guess
06/11/2024, 12:59 - +353 89 605 0161: Exactly the thinking that arrived at the wrong decision.
Stay small. Stay in your lane.
06/11/2024, 13:00 - +44 7599 430972: Speaking of 500 years lost of progress - Baptism of Europe
06/11/2024, 13:00 - +44 7599 430972: You can compare texts written by pagan and early Christians and feel standards dropping
06/11/2024, 13:03 - Will-hazzer777: Yeah the new testament is written in Koine greek which was the common greek of the day, not in sophisticated language. <This message was edited>
06/11/2024, 13:03 - +44 7599 430972: Depends on the gospel

06/11/2024, 13:16 - +44 7516 029853: a fantastic answer, however I can see that you have lost faith.

06/11/2024, 17:30 - Parag-meetup: Come again
06/11/2024, 17:30 - Parag-meetup: The full story
06/11/2024, 17:30 - +44 7599 430972: Lukashenko voided the passports of ones who left and in order to get a new one you have to physically return to Belarus to your local police station
06/11/2024, 17:31 - +44 7599 430972: Europe said they will think of something and then did nothing
06/11/2024, 17:31 - +44 7599 430972: It’s been like that for 3 years
06/11/2024, 17:35 - +91 80720 44735: You can't even visit Europe, right?
06/11/2024, 17:35 - +91 80720 44735: After Brexit? 🤦‍♂️ <This message was edited>
06/11/2024, 17:36 - +44 7599 430972: I can’t even visit Northern Ireland
06/11/2024, 17:37 - +44 7599 430972: I mean even if I did have the passport you still need visa if you’re from Belarus
06/11/2024, 17:49 - Parag-meetup: So what do you have here ?
06/11/2024, 17:49 - Parag-meetup: Work visa ?

06/11/2024, 17:55 - Parag-meetup: You can get ILR in 5 years

06/11/2024, 17:56 - Parag-meetup: How many years left ?
06/11/2024, 17:56 - +44 7599 430972: I still need to initiate leaving the citizenship procedure somehow
06/11/2024, 17:57 - +44 7599 430972: 2 more
06/11/2024, 18:09 - Parag-meetup: What’s that ?
06/11/2024, 18:09 - Parag-meetup: I don’t think so you have to
06/11/2024, 18:14 - +44 7599 430972: I mean otherwise I need to get approval for everything from Belarus. Like if I want to marry I need to get a certificate that I am not married there, if I want to change name, file taxes, etc
06/11/2024, 18:16 - +44 7516 029853: ah, you are Belarusian, not russian. it's just rare from you, but suddenly хороший русский vibes appeared.  maybe it's because I've never met you and you were sarcastic, which I couldn't recognise
06/11/2024, 18:19 - +44 7599 430972: Yeah I'm usually sarcastic
06/11/2024, 18:19 - +44 7599 430972: It's a defense mechanism
06/11/2024, 18:23 - +44 7516 029853: alright, this chat is getting sad.

06/11/2024, 18:41 - +44 7599 430972: Idk, firstly it's not like they are an easy place to get into, secondly I already mane a rushed decision of moving to the UK thinking it's a solid choice and got stuck
06/11/2024, 18:41 - +44 7599 430972: We will cross that bridge once we get there
06/11/2024, 18:42 - +44 7599 430972: I don't know a lot of languages, so it's a limitation. But ideally somewhere where I can build wealth by reasonably fair methods
06/11/2024, 18:46 - +44 7958 612614: Not sure what’s wrong with the UK?  Loads of opportunities, not much bureaucracy, nice people...
06/11/2024, 18:48 - +44 7958 612614: This is a rare country which is not a police state - meaning the police doesn’t stop you on the street just to check your documents
06/11/2024, 18:48 - +44 7599 430972: You forgot about splendid weather
06/11/2024, 18:48 - +44 7958 612614: It’s not the worst
06/11/2024, 18:51 - +44 7599 430972: Well I honestly don’t see career here. Many positions in my field require relocation to the US if you want to progress. I think you can have nice career if you’re a banker or a doctor, but not that much in other spheres
06/11/2024, 18:51 - +353 89 605 0161: Ever lived in another country @⁨~Martin⁩?
I don't disagree, I think UK is still top tier country, just curious.
06/11/2024, 18:51 - +44 7958 612614: zillion startups
06/11/2024, 18:52 - +44 7958 612614: I actively live in 3
06/11/2024, 18:52 - +353 89 605 0161: At once!?
06/11/2024, 18:52 - +44 7599 430972: I can’t work in companies with less than N headcount
06/11/2024, 18:52 - +44 7958 612614: 6 omonths here - 6 abroad
06/11/2024, 18:52 - +353 89 605 0161: Too right
06/11/2024, 18:52 - +44 7958 612614: but not in one chunk - off and on
06/11/2024, 18:52 - +44 7599 430972: UK, Great Britain, England
06/11/2024, 18:52 - +44 7958 612614: oh, WTF??
06/11/2024, 18:53 - +44 7599 430972: Yes that’s government requirements for visa license
06/11/2024, 18:53 - +44 7958 612614: still, you can join a startup unofficially and vest yourself once fully legal
06/11/2024, 18:53 - +44 7599 430972: Also not really zillion, how many unicorns there been in the past 5 years?
06/11/2024, 18:53 - +44 7599 430972: I recall one
06/11/2024, 18:53 - +44 7958 612614: what’s unicorns to do with it?
06/11/2024, 18:54 - +44 7958 612614: you want a guarantee that a startup will become one?
06/11/2024, 18:54 - +44 7958 612614: lol
06/11/2024, 18:54 - +44 7599 430972: They’re on the coat of arms
06/11/2024, 18:54 - +353 89 605 0161: CCP spy?
06/11/2024, 18:54 - +44 7958 612614: I even contribute on not-for-profit projects
06/11/2024, 18:54 - +44 7599 430972: I mean if the chances are one out of zillion…..
06/11/2024, 18:54 - +44 7958 612614: lol, if I were - you’d never suspect
06/11/2024, 18:56 - +44 7958 612614: i believe that if you just concentrate on meeting people and jumping on opportunities - money will come
06/11/2024, 18:56 - +44 7958 612614: it doesn’t have to be a unicorn for you to make a nice money … have you heard of serial entrepreneurs?
06/11/2024, 18:56 - +44 7599 430972: Btw you’re not allowed to do any job outside your occupation code on the work visa
06/11/2024, 18:57 - +44 7958 612614: not even volunteer on a project?
06/11/2024, 18:57 - +44 7599 430972: I’m surprised how rigorous and counter-intuitive those rules are
06/11/2024, 18:57 - +44 7599 430972: Not if you will be paid
06/11/2024, 18:57 - +44 7599 430972: Or somehow legally bound

06/11/2024, 19:01 - +44 7599 430972: All ineligible for visa. I don’t want to be cynical, I allow that there is a place for me to find good work and be happy, just wasn’t presented with opportunity

There are planes fighting around with mostly no one on board some parts of the day and some parts of the year season. They don't sell every ticket and you can try get those tickets for cheap if your very spontaneous person.

Some passengers just don't want to fly at 2am.

It's kind of a shame because you'd think if they got empty seats that day sell them off cheap but they don't always. Those plane ticket machines behave abit like a live stock market machines but you can work your way around to a degree. <This message was edited>

14/11/2024, 10:07 - +44 7599 430972: Yes, in order to increase testosterone levels you need:
* High-protein diet (cooking)
* ⁠Appreciating body’s physique (art/painting)
* ⁠Spending a lot of time outdoors, unity with nature (gardening)
* ⁠This is not a hard requirement, but it’s generally more convenient if a man knows how to speak (languages)

Why are British people like this?
17/11/2024, 11:30 - +44 7599 430972: Upd. The numbers were wrong, amount of cults per head is the same
17/11/2024, 11:34 - +44 7516 029853: fake news
17/11/2024, 11:35 - +44 7516 029853: "Statistics on cults per capita are not comprehensively tracked globally, as definitions of "cult" and their recognition vary widely by country and culture. However, several observations provide insight:

1. United States: The U.S. has one of the highest numbers of cults due to its history of religious freedom and the prevalence of small, independent religious movements. Notable examples include the Church of Scientology and older groups like the Branch Davidians【9】【10】.


2. Japan: Groups like Aum Shinrikyo and various spiritual organizations suggest a higher per capita presence of cult-like groups, reflecting Japan's syncretic religious practices【10】【11】.


3. South Korea: Known for high-profile cults such as the Shincheonji Church, it has a notable number of small, secretive religious groups【10】【11】.


4. France: The country actively monitors sectarian groups, with government reports suggesting over 500 groups classified as cults【9】【10】.


5. Brazil: A mix of Christian offshoots and Afro-Brazilian spiritual movements contributes to a significant number of small sects and cults【11】.



Other countries, including India, Russia, Taiwan, and Germany, also host numerous independent religious and spiritual movements due to diverse religious traditions or social conditions conducive to their growth【9】【10】【11】.

For precise rankings and detailed per capita analysis, such data would likely need to come from country-specific sociological or governmental studies."

17/11/2024, 11:37 - +44 7599 430972: > The UK has a similar number of cults per capita to the US, with more than 500 cults active in the UK
17/11/2024, 11:40 - +44 7516 029853: it says the following 
"Figures quoted for the UK usually indicate 500+ cults in operation here. On a per capita basis the UK has a *similar* problem with the number of cults to that of the US."
17/11/2024, 11:41 - +44 7599 430972: According to the Family Survival Trust, 500k people in the UK are in a cult, which is .75% of the population.

The International Cultic Studies Association mentions between 2.5 and 5 million Americans in cults, so between .75 and 1.5 percent of the population.
17/11/2024, 11:41 - +44 7599 430972: Actually official stats are not in favour of the UK
17/11/2024, 11:46 - +44 7516 029853: "Cults in the UK and the USA differ in prevalence, types, and government response due to cultural, legal, and social differences.

United States

1. Prevalence: The U.S. has a significant number of cults, partly due to its strong tradition of religious freedom. Groups range from spiritual movements to controversial organizations like Scientology, the Branch Davidians, and NXIVM.


2. Characteristics: American cults often thrive in regions with less centralized regulation and where charismatic leaders can attract followers seeking spiritual, social, or financial salvation.


3. Government Response: While freedom of religion is protected under the First Amendment, legal action is typically taken against cults for criminal behavior (e.g., fraud, abuse) rather than their religious or social beliefs.


4. High-Profile Cases: Incidents such as the Jonestown Massacre (1978) and Waco Siege (1993) highlight the extremes of U.S. cult activity【9】【10】.



United Kingdom

1. Prevalence: The UK has fewer high-profile cults compared to the U.S., but groups like the Plymouth Brethren, the Unification Church, and some New Age movements are present.


2. Characteristics: Cults in the UK are often smaller and more secretive, focusing on exclusivity and loyalty. There is also a focus on immigrant religious groups, which are sometimes viewed through a cult lens.


3. Government Response: The UK monitors cults less overtly than France but has agencies that keep an eye on harmful sectarian activities. Legal cases often focus on fraud or abuse rather than religious practices.


4. Public Perception: There is a strong emphasis on individual rights, but cult-like behavior often becomes a media topic, with scrutiny on groups deemed harmful to members【9】【11】.



Comparison

Cultural Context: The U.S.'s decentralized and pluralistic society fosters a wider variety of cults, while the UK's more centralized culture may suppress overt cult-like behavior.

Size and Influence: American cults tend to be larger, with global influence (e.g., Scientology), while UK cults are more localized.

Public and Media Attention: Both countries' media scrutinize cults, but sensationalism and high-profile incidents are more common in the U.S.


Ultimately, while the U.S. is more known for cult activity, both nations face similar challenges in addressing the balance between freedom of belief and protection from harm."
17/11/2024, 11:46 - +44 7599 430972: Yeah no numbers isn't it
17/11/2024, 11:47 - +44 7599 430972: That's why I dislike chatGPT
17/11/2024, 11:48 - +44 7516 029853: "For precise rankings and detailed per capita analysis, such data would likely need to come from country-specific sociological or governmental studies."

but in the end you might see more smaller and weaker cults in the UK, but bigger and much more influential in the USA
17/11/2024, 11:49 - +44 7599 430972: non sequitur
17/11/2024, 11:49 - +44 7516 029853: you dislike almost everything I like (the UK, ChatGPT)

17/11/2024, 11:50 - +44 7599 430972: For all these statements there is statistical proof, but numbers I found say that UK has more people in cults per capita
17/11/2024, 11:50 - +44 7599 430972: Feel free to share numbers proving otherwise
17/11/2024, 11:50 - +44 7599 430972: How is the second statement is a corollary of the first?
17/11/2024, 11:55 - +44 7516 029853: I am arguing that, even if the number of cults per capita in the UK is similar to or higher than that in the US, which is challenging to measure accurately due to the nature of cults*, it does not imply that they have the same level of presence and influence within society.

*it is quite obvious to me that measuring cults in a tight -knit UK is far simpler than in the middle of the US
17/11/2024, 11:55 - +44 7599 430972: How do we measure presence or influence in the society?
17/11/2024, 11:57 - +44 7516 029853: suicide rates due to cult influence, approximate financial gains of the cult industry, other clear signs of societal influence
17/11/2024, 11:57 - +44 7599 430972: I don't think there are methods for measuring first one, second one can be estimated using cult income, however adjusted to the size of economy
17/11/2024, 12:02 - +44 7516 029853: I don't think there is perfect stats on that as well, but you asked a question ans I gave you some metrics which I find useful.

also, I was never interested enough in cults but living in both the US and the UK, it just screams how different it is. cults in the US are powerful and very present in comparison to the UK. but again, no perfect stats is present as the subject is too complicated
17/11/2024, 12:04 - onur: for better numbers use perplexity ai
17/11/2024, 12:05 - +44 7599 430972: This might just be cultural perception. Sometimes we believe that a thing is true due to media exposure but then turns out number claim otherwise
17/11/2024, 12:06 - +44 7516 029853: btw, I recently was leading a team on a AI hackathon and we were testing 5 systems but there was no perplexity :(
17/11/2024, 12:10 - +44 7516 029853: but if we apply logic and consider how US history has led to a much greater radicalisation (and coercion as a result), it gives insight into why the US might have more powerful and prominent cults

17/11/2024, 13:35 - +44 7599 430972: Also opposite doesn’t hold. I would say there are no cults in Saudi Arabia but I wouldn’t say it’s due to population smarts
17/11/2024, 13:36 - +44 7599 430972: I think cults have more to do with freedoms, government controls and economy
17/11/2024, 13:36 - +44 7599 430972: So in a way more cults might be better
17/11/2024, 13:48 - +44 7516 029853: good point
17/11/2024, 13:49 - onur: how?

17/11/2024, 13:53 - +44 7516 029853: but disagree with this

my home country is relatively free, the government doesn't control cults and the economy can be better. however, potentially there are less cults in R.M than the U.S. 
most likely it's, proving I have written above, due to lesser radicalised society and a relatively long period of enforced atheism

Is it no longer a friendship while it does?
22/11/2024, 13:22 - +44 7958 612614: sex is a way of making something stabler
22/11/2024, 13:23 - +44 7958 612614: exactly, you’re not sure
22/11/2024, 14:05 - +44 7516 029853: I have a close Aro/Ace friend and she explained it to me multiple times. I don't think I can do justice by repeating it, but in my understanding there is a special kind of relationship in aromatic/asexual relationships. 
these relationships are not purely friendship-based and there is a specific degree of intimacy reserved for them, while still keeping it asexual and aromantic.
22/11/2024, 14:09 - +44 7516 029853: at least as a heterosexual woman, I never felt attracted to my female friends (and they are all extremely beautiful).
with male friends for whom I had romantic feelings, in my experience, I either ended up dating them or the friendship ceased to exist
22/11/2024, 14:09 - +44 7516 029853: until it doesn't

23/11/2024, 10:43 - +44 7394 986609: Do you think some Stright/Bi women find it hard to be with men there develop more feelings for but that man is in a relationship and doesn't feel the same way?

From my experience I've seen men too end a friendship (if there ever was one) just because it did not change into a relationship. 

Is this just self insecurity that if you can't be in a relationship with them it's not worth trying? 

Skipping over step 2 to get to 3? Is there more most men and women following there biological urge to breed?
23/11/2024, 11:14 - +44 7516 029853: my female friends don't seem to follow the same pattern when they romantically like someone and the feelings aren't reciprocated.
however, I can't count how many times my "friends" stopped being friends with me once it turned out they had intentions from the very beginning to become a couple and I didn't see it going into that direction (according to my friends, it's a strong pattern, thought maybe to a lesser degree).
I have never tried to build a solid platonic relationship with a heterosexual man I liked romantically, pretending it was just platonic while waiting for it to evolve. I do believe there’s something gender-based at play, maybe biology, but the difference is quite clear.
23/11/2024, 12:32 - onur: where are those extremely beautiful friends
23/11/2024, 12:34 - onur: who needs a female friend
23/11/2024, 12:34 - onur: they are boring

23/11/2024, 12:35 - onur: all she talks about is her dates etc
23/11/2024, 12:35 - onur: 😅
23/11/2024, 12:36 - onur: and if its otherwise (she is attractive and has great conversation) why would I just want to be friends? It is already an extremely rare catch, so Id like to try my luck
23/11/2024, 13:43 - +44 7958 612614: There’s an “exclusivity” norm which applies both to romantic and non-romantic relationships.  There are some people who are quite relaxed about it and I wonder what would be their view.  Theoretically, it’s almost like something’s missing - going beyond 2.  Both above 2 and below 2 is sub-optimal.  Wanting a romantic relationship is striving towards 2.  Then, we can analyse “platonic” relationship - it’s not enough in terms of commitment or interest into being a part of other person’s or people lives.  That’s why we hear often term “meaningful relationships”.  Some think it means romantic, but i don’t think so.   There are communities where there’s this primary nuclear connection between 2 people, but the bonds are relatively loose, so people frequently change partners, but the whole group remains involved in life goals.  Humanity will eventually need to get out of that 2 paradigm in order to capitalise on more intense collaboration and synergising.
23/11/2024, 14:08 - +44 7516 029853: why do you dm me then? 😂
23/11/2024, 14:08 - +44 7516 029853: I don't it's only about exclusivity,  it looks more like emotional immaturity abs inability to find a win-win scenario when life events change the friendship/romantic relationship dynamics
23/11/2024, 14:15 - +44 7958 612614: it’s an ego and cognitive and existential need to involve other people in your life for problem solving, power consolidation and dopamine (among other things).  Platonic relationship can be valid if 2 people are working on a project together (writing a book, for example) - because their goals get very aligned and their destinies become potentially interconnected.  Then, there comes a dependence on that person because you’re aware you have something valuable and there’s a threat that someone else will figure out the worth of the person and take it away from you.  The availability / capacity of a single person is limited, most of us are able only to “service” one relationship.  Sex and romantic side is a way of putting a barbed wire around yoru relationship or introducing further benefits in order to keep what’s good for yourself.
23/11/2024, 14:17 - +44 7958 612614: And I haven’t even touched on the need for having kids that some people have - then it becomes a purpose in itself and everything connected with a child ideally requires exclusive and strong relationship.  Some people are aware that most of their problems would be resolved if they got into a relationship.  Platonic just won’t cut it because the hooks are not deep enough to allow for emotional blackmail, etc…

26/11/2024, 13:23 - onur: check donald hoffmans interface theory of perception
26/11/2024, 13:23 - onur: Hoffman argues that evolution has not shaped humans or other animals to perceive reality as it truly is. Instead, perception works as an "interface," much like a computer desktop, simplifying and hiding the complexity of underlying reality in favor of survival and reproduction.

Example with Flies and Beer Bottles:

Hoffman gives an example of jewel beetles mistaking beer bottles for females. The shiny, brown glass of certain beer bottles resembles the glossy texture of a female beetle’s shell. Male beetles attempt to mate with the bottles, even to the point of exhaustion or death. This demonstrates that their perception evolved not to grasp "truth" but to respond effectively to reproductive cues.

In the broader sense, Hoffman argues that what animals (and humans) perceive is more like a survival-focused "user interface" rather than an accurate representation of objective reality.
26/11/2024, 13:24 - onur: :((
26/11/2024, 13:26 - +353 89 605 0161: I shall!
26/11/2024, 13:27 - +353 89 605 0161: Just on the joke (which I've decided to defend for some reason)

Here's what ChatGPT throws out if you ask it to explain over analysis via evolutionary psychology
26/11/2024, 13:27 - +353 89 605 0161: Overanalyzing is a trait that can be explained through the theory of evolution as a byproduct of human cognitive development, which prioritized survival and problem-solving. Here’s how evolutionary theory accounts for it:

### 1. **Hyperactive Agency Detection**  
Early humans lived in environments filled with threats (predators, hostile groups, or environmental hazards). Overanalyzing, or seeing patterns and intentions where they might not exist, likely evolved as a survival mechanism. For example:
- Hearing a rustle in the bushes and assuming it’s a predator was safer than ignoring it.
- Over-interpreting ambiguous social cues helped humans anticipate potential dangers or conflicts.

This "better safe than sorry" mindset may have led to the development of a heightened sensitivity to stimuli, which now manifests as overanalysis in modern contexts.

---

### 2. **Problem-Solving and Anticipation**  
Humans evolved to be exceptional problem-solvers, constantly analyzing their environment to anticipate outcomes. This ability helped with:
- **Hunting and gathering**: Predicting the movement of prey or the growth cycle of plants.
- **Social interactions**: Deciphering intentions and alliances within groups to avoid conflict and maintain cohesion.

Overanalyzing is a modern extension of this trait, applied to complex and often abstract scenarios where immediate survival is no longer at stake.

---

### 3. **Social Complexity and Intelligence**  
Humans evolved in increasingly complex social structures. Understanding relationships, managing alliances, and interpreting subtle social cues required nuanced thought. Overanalyzing social situations likely offered an evolutionary advantage:
- Misinterpreting a neutral expression as hostility might have prompted cautious behavior, reducing the risk of confrontation.
- Detailed scrutiny of interactions strengthened bonds and reduced misunderstandings.

Today, this trait persists even when the stakes are low, such as interpreting the tone of an email.

---

### 4. **Modern Mismatch**  
In our evolutionary past, overanalyzing helped humans survive immediate dangers and navigate social intricacies. However, in the modern world, many situations lack the life-or-death urgency that shaped this trait. For example:
- **Ambiguous stimuli**: We may overanalyze a vague text message because our brains are wired to seek clarity and avoid uncertainty.
- **Abundance of choices**: Modern life presents us with decisions (career paths, relationships, etc.) far more complex than those faced by our ancestors, triggering overanalysis.

---

### Conclusion  
Overanalyzing stems from cognitive tools honed by evolution to protect and benefit us in survival contexts. However, in the relatively low-stakes, ambiguous, and information-saturated modern world, these same mechanisms can lead to overthinking, even when unnecessary.
26/11/2024, 13:28 - +353 89 605 0161: The point isn't whether humans over of under analyse, it's that evolutionaey psychology can be used to explain contradictory statements.

Its too flexible to be useful.
26/11/2024, 13:32 - onur: but this is a wrong explanation, though it started correctlt
26/11/2024, 13:33 - onur: i would say overthinking is a byproduct
26/11/2024, 13:33 - onur: it could be beneficial or harmful depending on the situation
26/11/2024, 13:33 - onur: no one would claim it is essential for survival
26/11/2024, 13:34 - +353 89 605 0161: How would you prove that?
26/11/2024, 13:34 - onur: and u can see this easily by yourself, most of the overthinkers are alone/ unable to mate/ unable to succesfully pass their traits to next gen
26/11/2024, 13:34 - onur: by comparing with other animals that survived :D
26/11/2024, 13:35 - onur: almost no other animal is able to overanalyse yet analyse stuff
26/11/2024, 13:35 - onur: maybe hunter animals
26/11/2024, 13:36 - onur: there are animals which survived even without a nervous system
26/11/2024, 13:36 - onur: or bacteria are survivors too
26/11/2024, 13:36 - onur: I don't think they analyse stuff :D
26/11/2024, 13:37 - onur: and another proof is that we know that we are tend to under analyse aka dont see/interperet some details for survival/ better focus
26/11/2024, 13:37 - +353 89 605 0161: Did we evolve to walk upright for our survival?
26/11/2024, 13:38 - onur: no I guess, because there are near relatives who are not bipedal
26/11/2024, 13:39 - onur: and walking upright causes some diseases/ disadvantages
26/11/2024, 13:39 - onur: that is also known
26/11/2024, 13:41 - onur: and btw natural selection (survival of the fittest) is only a part of evolution there are other mechanisms
26/11/2024, 13:42 - onur: im a bit triggered with the joke because it sounds like created by a religious person who thinks that he understands evolution just because its not a monkey joke but he doesn't
26/11/2024, 13:43 - +353 89 605 0161: It's not a joke about evolution, it's about evolutionary psychology.

27/11/2024, 14:21 - +44 7958 612614: get a 🚴‍♀️
27/11/2024, 14:41 - +44 7516 029853: it might be linked with a Railcard, as an example
27/11/2024, 14:42 - +44 7958 612614: what what does the railcard give you that a normal card doesn/t?
27/11/2024, 14:45 - +44 7516 029853: 1/3 off on the tube and most rails when off-peak
27/11/2024, 17:13 - +44 7394 986609: This as being picking my brain lately. 

I wonder if some cultures had women give birth and raise multiple children from multiple men out of survival or us humans have large range of Adaptability so the social acceptability fluctuates depending of the environmental circumstances. 

Maybe some of us men and women have this biological urge so to speak and need this ich scratched hence why polyamory and polygamy exist. <This message was edited>
27/11/2024, 17:16 - +44 7394 986609: Interesting point.
27/11/2024, 17:18 - +44 7958 612614: you know what - it’s survival (presumably for the sake of it??) that we usually take to be the base layer of our strivings.  What about if our pre-destined striving is to create meaningful relationships with one another and survival is just means to an end?  That’s the phenomenon of many of our theories - evolution (except that you take life for granted).  Yep, so I’m not survival centric believer at all.  I think it’s BS. <This message was edited>
27/11/2024, 17:23 - +44 7958 612614: What a crazy idea that “survival of the species” is somehow our purpose in life.  Why???   It’s just the first thing that analytical monkeys noticed <This message was edited>
27/11/2024, 17:30 - +44 7958 612614: OK, it’s not my idea - that’s pretty much Advaita Vedanta Buddhism..
27/11/2024, 17:36 - +44 7394 986609: It's OK. 

The meny teachings of the pasted hold up to today thousands of years later.

Are there any labels transcend survival? Or they just bullshit?

is transcend a woo woo word to begin with? Enlightenment?

Or bringing them into existence is just as important to create a new perception of survival?

That is a challenging balence in my point of veiw. <This message was edited>
27/11/2024, 17:38 - +44 7958 612614: I don’t know - but life itself for the sake of life is pretty terminal thing.  Transcending promises new boundaries.  Haven’t got a clue, but interesting stuff for sure.

02/12/2024, 10:15 - +44 7394 986609: Haven't found much apart from one who is a French lawyer who was in a recent court case requesting he's information to be deleted under GDPR. <This message was edited>

02/12/2024, 10:20 - +44 7394 986609: Most likely. 

I wonder how much really scrubbed off the Internet under GDPR.

Only success I've seen was a performing artists group from the 2000s but that's because it was so niche.
02/12/2024, 10:22 - +353 89 605 0161: There should be a name complexity requirement for this stuff.

David Mayer is way too ordinary a name to be blocking all AI content creation <This message was edited>
02/12/2024, 10:22 - +44 7394 986609: Maybe the flooding with A.I information and imagery might distort of the information on the internet. 

You might have to really depend on archives but there under threat and self censoring to find information. 🙁
02/12/2024, 10:24 - +44 7394 986609: Is it too complex or long of a job for 1 person to do in a life time?

A.I assistants could help.
02/12/2024, 10:26 - onur: well someone must have discovered it by accident
02/12/2024, 10:31 - +353 89 605 0161: Surprised it took so long, unless it was as part of recent update.

The hard stop is probably the worst way ChatGPT could handle it if this person doesn't want attention 😂
02/12/2024, 10:40 - +44 7958 612614: There must be thousands and thousands of people who have requested the removal - that’s just not a plausable explanation…
02/12/2024, 10:41 - onur: other explanations don't make sense either this is the most reasonable one
02/12/2024, 10:41 - onur: so far 🤣
02/12/2024, 10:42 - +44 7958 612614: oh well, if you’re happy with that explanation - go with it
02/12/2024, 10:42 - onur: if it was an AI issue, others would be affected by it as well but no
02/12/2024, 10:42 - onur: like other AIs would also break down
02/12/2024, 10:43 - onur: but they are fine
02/12/2024, 10:45 - +44 7958 612614: of course it’s not “a glitch” - it’s a block.  Now, I don’t see the wisdom of it, so might be experimental, but in any case - this just shows you that information they provide can be completely wrong, biased, intermittent - literally anything and there’s no way of even proving it (in case of intermittency).  And even if you prove - there’s no mechanism to “demand” a certain behaviour from the model
02/12/2024, 10:46 - +44 7958 612614: Also, it’s a fact that a handful of people stand behind these decisions that affect (or will soon affect) every single person on the planet
02/12/2024, 10:47 - +44 7958 612614: I hope I’m not saying anything new here - whenever there’s a way to manipulate a certain system - it’s certain it will be done, if it’s deemed to be advantageous to someone.
02/12/2024, 10:48 - +44 7958 612614: these LLMs are doing language chaining - it’s in one of the pre-processors.  It’s like a huge filtration chain
02/12/2024, 10:49 - +44 7958 612614: so if I were to while label any LLM solution (or create my own AI assistant and offer it to teh world)
02/12/2024, 10:53 - +44 7958 612614: I would be running a few chains and the first one would be - if the input contains david and mayer or my output contains david and mayer - return this message instead “blah blah blah”
02/12/2024, 10:54 - +44 7958 612614: but I could have an implementation that allows it through - simply ommitting this preprocessing
02/12/2024, 11:57 - onur: idk if there is any wisdom behind it
02/12/2024, 11:58 - onur: people are talking about it on social media I thought it would fit in the meme group :D
02/12/2024, 12:00 - +44 7958 612614: well, yes - it’s weird.  They could have just manipulated (mocked or faked) the response.  I think they are working on censorship and it’s not working at the moment 😉
02/12/2024, 12:03 - onur: no response isn't fake I tried it myself too
02/12/2024, 12:05 - +353 89 605 0161: ChatGPT could have though, is I think what's meant there. 
As in, instead of giving that error response, just make something boring up.
02/12/2024, 12:06 - +353 89 605 0161: The error response has gotten David Mayer more attention than anything else could have 😂

02/12/2024, 12:10 - +353 89 605 0161: It was also the year this group created this memes chat too (I think) so we've really got our finger on the pulse
02/12/2024, 12:15 - +44 7452 968792: Yes, I read somewhere that David Mayer could be referring to the Rothschild which wouldn’t be a surprise there 🤔 but the question is what are they hiding!
02/12/2024, 13:16 - +44 7958 612614: yes, but it’s not about Rotschilds in particular - it’s a part of a broader theme….  Anyway, people can easily find out

05/12/2024, 10:40 - +44 7958 612614: He was in a dark place at the time
05/12/2024, 10:42 - +353 89 605 0161: We've all been there.
It's only our moral luck that we've never enacted martial law. Who are we to judge?
05/12/2024, 10:47 - +44 7958 612614: Given half a chance - i would have done it … the documentation was unclear and I kept getting Error 5225 Permission denied.
05/12/2024, 10:52 - onur: what can't you explain by language? :D
05/12/2024, 10:54 - +44 7958 612614: Why can’t you explain everything telepathically or why can’t you describe a beautiful smell using musical notation?
05/12/2024, 10:55 - +44 7958 612614: Why do you play video games when you could read an article that would express everything?
05/12/2024, 10:55 - onur: yes because there are not enough concepts and definitions in musical notation
05/12/2024, 10:55 - +353 89 605 0161: Mary's Room thought experiment
05/12/2024, 10:55 - onur: and I dont know the nature of telepathy
05/12/2024, 10:55 - +353 89 605 0161: Is first thing that comes to mind on this
05/12/2024, 10:56 - +44 7958 612614: well, Einstein, that’s why you can’t describe everything using language - not enough of what it takes to do the job
05/12/2024, 10:56 - +353 89 605 0161: Using what you first said, express rather than explain.
05/12/2024, 10:56 - +44 7958 612614: use language to express it
05/12/2024, 10:58 - onur: I am?
05/12/2024, 10:58 - +44 7958 612614: @⁨onur⁩ I seriously don’t even know how you come up with these sweeping statements?  Basically, you’re saying that the sophistication and quality of the language is on par with the quality of the reality itself and even metaphysical stuff
05/12/2024, 10:58 - onur: you don't have to explain the undiscovered and unknown stuff
05/12/2024, 10:58 - onur: because we dont know them
05/12/2024, 10:59 - onur: yet still I can categorize them with few words
05/12/2024, 10:59 - +44 7958 612614: and which language in particular?  Are all languages the same?  Is Python also capable of describing “everything”?
05/12/2024, 10:59 - onur: yes
05/12/2024, 10:59 - onur: :D
05/12/2024, 10:59 - +44 7958 612614: you can just hint at something that stirs your emotions, like an ape grumping at a rotten banana
05/12/2024, 11:00 - +44 7958 612614: Rodney, you’re a bloody genius! 🤣
05/12/2024, 11:01 - +44 7958 612614: so, I can’t easily describe Rodney to people who haven’t watched Only Fools and Horses - I need to use it only as an analogy to something that they are already familiar with.
05/12/2024, 11:01 - onur: im checking marys room, it seems unrelated
05/12/2024, 11:01 - onur: but still you are somehow able to describe it
05/12/2024, 11:02 - +44 7958 612614: please turn off the lights once done and make sure you don’t leave the mess behind
05/12/2024, 11:02 - onur: there is not 1 ideal description of something and all descriptions we are doing are somewhat off
05/12/2024, 11:02 - onur: you are speaking as if so
05/12/2024, 11:02 - +44 7958 612614: oh, I love that secret ingredient called “somehow”
05/12/2024, 11:02 - +353 89 605 0161: Read it better 😉 <This message was edited>
05/12/2024, 11:04 - onur: I dont understand your point of view
05/12/2024, 11:05 - +44 7958 612614: Language, as a concept, is an interpretation of something.  It’s not the real thing - it tries to convey some underlying stuff
05/12/2024, 11:05 - onur: linguistic definition doesnt have to be the exact representation of what is happening, and it cant be
05/12/2024, 11:05 - onur: but you can use words to explain this concept
05/12/2024, 11:05 - +44 7958 612614: If it’s not exact, it can’t cover the entire resolution of entirety - that’s what you said
05/12/2024, 11:05 - onur: as I just did
05/12/2024, 11:06 - +44 7958 612614: so clumsily that we’re getting nowhere
05/12/2024, 11:06 - onur: nothing can cover anything's entirety, this is an idealistic approach
05/12/2024, 11:06 - onur: things change
05/12/2024, 11:06 - +44 7958 612614: that’s what you said - you said that ineffable is meaningless
05/12/2024, 11:07 - onur: yes because it is a definition itself 😅
05/12/2024, 11:08 - onur: think of it like the criticism of full skepticism
05/12/2024, 11:08 - +44 7958 612614: like that smiley face can help you 🤣
05/12/2024, 11:08 - +44 7958 612614: ok, so how about this - there are some people whose thoughts cannot push the boundaries of the language.
05/12/2024, 11:09 - +44 7958 612614: but some people can think of concepts that are difficult to even cognitively grasp - they come in flashes - language can’t touch those
05/12/2024, 11:09 - onur: so they dont know enough vocabulary
05/12/2024, 11:09 - onur: or information
05/12/2024, 11:09 - onur: they cant even define what they think
05/12/2024, 11:09 - onur: it is worthless
05/12/2024, 11:10 - onur: what should I do with it?
05/12/2024, 11:10 - onur: or anyone?
05/12/2024, 11:10 - +44 7958 612614: Are you one of those 5 year olds that look like they are 30?
05/12/2024, 11:10 - onur: if someone is having a glimpse of a feeling that even they cannot describe,

I wouldnt describe it as wisdom 😅
05/12/2024, 11:11 - +44 7599 430972: Look at you, having a philosophical linguistic discussion in a chat which Roger isn’t even a part of!
05/12/2024, 11:11 - onur: I am sure I have experienced more bizarre stuff compared to you and I am having this stance
05/12/2024, 11:11 - +44 7958 612614: no, wisdom is something completely different.  It’s a “self-restrain” - not acting , but delaying a bit
05/12/2024, 11:12 - onur: if you are not able to express something it is almost next to 0
05/12/2024, 11:12 - +44 7958 612614: OK, I’m out, had enough of this.  I could be making money right now
05/12/2024, 11:13 - onur: everybody knows I am right but I understand there is an appeal to these kinds of mystic approaches, maybe there is something we cant explain ha? what a universe, lets stop thinking about it
05/12/2024, 11:13 - onur: 😅
05/12/2024, 11:14 - onur: such a mystery
05/12/2024, 11:14 - +353 89 605 0161: I don't get how this isn't dead in the water idea 😅
05/12/2024, 11:14 - +353 89 605 0161: Express a colour in words.
Any colour.
05/12/2024, 11:14 - onur: BROWN
05/12/2024, 11:14 - onur: :D
05/12/2024, 11:14 - +353 89 605 0161: Which is what Mary's room was about
05/12/2024, 11:15 - +353 89 605 0161: Thats labelling.
05/12/2024, 11:15 - +353 89 605 0161: Not expressing
05/12/2024, 11:15 - +353 89 605 0161: That wouldn't inform anyone who hadn't seen a colour of what brown is
05/12/2024, 11:16 - onur: it is a form of expression, which form of expression is perfect according to you so we are reducing from it by using language?
05/12/2024, 11:16 - onur: its their problem dont you think?
05/12/2024, 11:17 - +353 89 605 0161: Irrelevant
05/12/2024, 11:17 - onur: the relevancy is that there is a lack of information by the recipient
05/12/2024, 11:17 - onur: rather than inability of language
05/12/2024, 11:17 - +353 89 605 0161: If it isn't perfect then it's missing something, so not _everything_ has been expressed.
05/12/2024, 11:18 - +353 89 605 0161: That doesn't work.
You should then be able to fill in their knowledge gap with language.
05/12/2024, 11:26 - onur: but nothing is perfect and this is an unrealistic expectation
05/12/2024, 11:26 - onur: and everything is changing
05/12/2024, 11:27 - +44 7599 430972: <Media omitted>
05/12/2024, 11:27 - +353 89 605 0161: We'll get to it jeez
05/12/2024, 11:28 - onur: why? the last I checked express means = to communicate what you think or feel by speaking or writing or in some other way
05/12/2024, 11:28 - onur: could be art as well 😅
05/12/2024, 11:29 - onur: what you describe is learning
05/12/2024, 11:29 - onur: and yes you are right, language is the best way to learn!
05/12/2024, 11:30 - onur: this cant be true
05/12/2024, 11:32 - +353 89 605 0161: Exactly.
But your message before was "everything can be expressed by language"
Written or spoken doesn't matter. There's plenty of thoughts you're not able to express with language. Just like a colour.

You cannot use words to communicate the thought of a colour to someone who had never seen colour before. So you're not able to express everything with language.
05/12/2024, 11:33 - +353 89 605 0161: Sometimes sure.
05/12/2024, 11:33 - onur: https://www.pcgamesn.com/steam/pile-of-shame
05/12/2024, 11:34 - onur: to me even saying "thoughts that I am unable to express" is a way of expressing those thoughts
05/12/2024, 11:34 - onur: you see where I am coming from?
05/12/2024, 11:38 - +353 89 605 0161: I think so.
But no I don't agree that that is expressing the thoughts.
Thats just expressing the inability to express them.
But doesn't give us anything about what those thoughts are. Only rules out things maybe. <This message was edited>
05/12/2024, 11:38 - +353 89 605 0161: In the same way saying you don't know they way from A to B isn't expressing a route from A to B
05/12/2024, 11:41 - onur: well first things first, to me, we are discussing a hypothetical thing. 

I've never had any "thoughts" in my life that I won't be able to express

I think what dennett suggested, this cartesian theatre, I think we are more living in a platonic theatre...

even though we know nothing is perfect and everything is changing and theseus ship etc...

even though we have the maximum amount of information in the history of time to be able to express our feelings and thoughts...

people are still thinking that we are lacking our expression because it is not perfect 😅
05/12/2024, 11:42 - onur: I always felt like if I am not able to express something, I dont know it very well
05/12/2024, 11:42 - onur: after learning, I was able to express myself on that subject fairly comfortably
05/12/2024, 11:43 - onur: expression is a two sided coin
05/12/2024, 11:44 - onur: the recipient needs to have a similar level of understanding
05/12/2024, 11:44 - onur: in this case I dont believe there are things that couldn't be expressed if either parties wanted to understand 😅
05/12/2024, 11:46 - onur: how else are you going to express yourself anyways? even modern artworks have text explanations next to them
05/12/2024, 11:46 - onur: language is your best bet
05/12/2024, 12:06 - +44 7958 612614: you still going on?
05/12/2024, 12:06 - +353 89 605 0161: I'm not really commenting on language being the _best_ or not.
Im just talking about whether _everything_ can be expressed with it. 
If you think it can, but we just don't have enough language _yet_ then that's one thing, but I see no reason to think it'll get there. 

In terms of language being the best ; right tool for the right job.
Language isn't going to teach someone how to kick a ball better than watching someone else do it and then doing it yourself for example.

If the recipient needs similar understanding then I think that essentially proves language is insufficient to express everything.

05/12/2024, 13:20 - +44 7394 986609: A interesting discussion to all those contributed. Thank you. 👍
05/12/2024, 13:28 - +44 7394 986609: This reminds me of many discussions I've had with musicians and labeling genres. 

Some really care you do and some despise you using labels. 

When I want to look it up on the Internet for find more songs I like of similar sound it helps but some artists feel Labelling a song I think might subconsciously lock them in from creating new music. 

I've known musicians go on 'music depriving periods'

The theory is so they reduce there exposer to hearing music in there day to day life's and try to forget humming or when there mind is trying to be still think of another song whiles flicking though strings. 

The aim I to create something 'original' or 'unheard of' if its even possible.
05/12/2024, 14:02 - onur: there is that as well
05/12/2024, 14:02 - onur: language also evolves and changes
05/12/2024, 14:02 - onur: to encapsulate what we are experiencing

05/12/2024, 18:43 - onur: why is she used?
05/12/2024, 18:43 - onur: did she say something stupid?
05/12/2024, 18:46 - +44 7599 430972: She fled North Korea and was actively interviewed in many places
05/12/2024, 18:46 - +44 7599 430972: However as time went by she would tell more and more out of pocket stories (to stay relevant I assume)
05/12/2024, 18:47 - +44 7599 430972: Her name is Yeonmi Park

05/12/2024, 19:47 - onur: lol at least I wasnt alone
05/12/2024, 19:47 - onur: 🤣
05/12/2024, 19:47 - onur: Hey there, nucleoli here to explain the joke. This is Yeonmi Park, who escaped North Korea and now spreads the word about the oppression & human rights violations there, especially starvation. This is a screenshot from [Joe Rogan #1691](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0G5o6GYjWgbSvKG3W2W2xO) where she was a guest 


The joke is comparing the harmless and good-natured [Turkish ice cream](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=v2f09JgbZW4) routine to legit mass starvation and famine. As others have said, she has been called out often for changing & exaggerating some details, so this is an example of poking fun at that. 


This has been nucleoli splitting the atom of knowledge. Peace!
05/12/2024, 19:48 - onur: I didnt know people were able to accumulate that much fat in North Korea btw

06/12/2024, 12:02 - onur: yes
06/12/2024, 12:02 - onur: she posted a phd thesis where she discusses mentioning peoples' smell is racist
06/12/2024, 12:08 - +353 89 605 0161: Ah
06/12/2024, 12:08 - +353 89 605 0161: Incel shit

06/12/2024, 12:12 - onur: it sounds like just another phenomenology paper 😅
06/12/2024, 13:25 - +353 89 605 0161: She/her thesis isn't.
From a quick Google, the hate she gets is typical incel shit.
Low comprehension skills.
Misplaced aggression.
06/12/2024, 13:35 - +44 7516 029853: as someone who has been really into perfumery and the world of scent for years (I even did a bit of training to sharpen my sense of smell), I’m so glad she’s done this work. 
it might come across as "woke" to some, but it’s actually based on something very real. honestly, most people don’t realise how huge, politically charged and complex the world of scent is (mainly because it’s so tightly gatekept)
06/12/2024, 13:36 - +44 7516 029853: this
06/12/2024, 13:37 - +44 7516 029853: tell me your favourite perfume and I will tell you if you are an incel or not
06/12/2024, 13:50 - onur: I dont like perfumes
06/12/2024, 13:50 - onur: I like natural :D
06/12/2024, 13:50 - onur: its chemical shit
06/12/2024, 13:51 - onur: gives me headache
06/12/2024, 13:52 - onur: maybe these body creams are ok they smell nice
06/12/2024, 13:52 - onur: and doesn't taste weird like perfumes
06/12/2024, 13:53 - +44 7516 029853: Onur stop eating/drinking perfumes
06/12/2024, 13:53 - onur: some people use them on their skins
06/12/2024, 13:55 - onur: i think this was an inincel reply because everybody who gets lucky knows these 🤣 who cares about parfumes
06/12/2024, 13:55 - onur: where there are pheronomes
06/12/2024, 13:55 - onur: lol
06/12/2024, 13:56 - onur: im not talking about deodorants tho
06/12/2024, 13:56 - onur: 😅
06/12/2024, 13:56 - onur: use them
06/12/2024, 14:05 - +44 7958 612614: I just sat down.  Weren’t you raving about odours the other day?  You’re like a door buzzer with an intermittent fault
06/12/2024, 15:29 - onur: yes but the odour I was complaining about is bacterial/ fungal infection bro not the natural ones
06/12/2024, 15:30 - onur: tbh im one of the most consistent people that you could meet

If he'd not deserted and had only drafted himself into the army he wouldn't have put himself in an such a life or death scenario....

He'd be in another one instead...

14/12/2024, 11:58 - Parag-meetup: It seems like a snapshot of an interview , you aren’t expected to provide proof during 2 minute interviews . 
If it was an article published by BBC , I can bet my hat that they would produce the proof
14/12/2024, 11:59 - +353 89 605 0161: Does it?
I thought the "scandals" were that things were still being manufactured where it's cheapest, then stopping off in low tax jurisdictions for _the final piece_ to pay the tax there.

Or the various patents can be registered in the low tax jurisdictions so the profit goes through there.
14/12/2024, 11:59 - +353 89 605 0161: That is a BBC article
14/12/2024, 11:59 - +353 89 605 0161: https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd0elzk24dno
14/12/2024, 11:59 - +353 89 605 0161: It's just not very interesting so I didn't link it all 🤷‍♂
14/12/2024, 12:00 - Parag-meetup: It’s a quote of a spokesperson claiming that
14/12/2024, 12:01 - +353 89 605 0161: You're expectations are too low I think.
14/12/2024, 12:01 - +353 89 605 0161: What's your point?
14/12/2024, 12:01 - +353 89 605 0161: A BBC spokesman, in a BBC article.
14/12/2024, 12:02 - Parag-meetup: The writer of the article is not professing that BBC is the most trusted source 
They are quoting someone
14/12/2024, 12:02 - +353 89 605 0161: If they are the most trusted, it must have come from somewhere so just drop that source in your statement and article
14/12/2024, 12:02 - Parag-meetup: They agent even saying it’s right 
They are just quoting
14/12/2024, 12:03 - +353 89 605 0161: But they are the BBC...
They are quoting themselves
14/12/2024, 12:04 - Parag-meetup: No they are quoting a bbc spokesperson
14/12/2024, 12:05 - +353 89 605 0161: The spokesman is speaking for the BBC that's why they call him a spokesman
14/12/2024, 12:06 - +353 89 605 0161: The article is speaking for the BBC, that's why it's under a BBC heading and on the BBC site
14/12/2024, 12:07 - +353 89 605 0161: If you're going to include a statement like that in your article why wouldn't you just include the relevant source?

It's just people missing obvious shit in their job.

Trust in media is at such a low point why do journalists miss the easy points.
14/12/2024, 12:09 - +353 89 605 0161: The spokesman may not have had it to hand in his speech, which is poor preparation.
But writing an article you can pause to back that statement up.
14/12/2024, 12:10 - +44 7599 430972: On Alex's side here, that's cringe
14/12/2024, 12:10 - +44 7599 430972: Posting some rando's quote in a middle of an article to corroborate the point is equivalent of "my father thinks so"
14/12/2024, 12:17 - Parag-meetup: I agree to certain extent 
But bigger picture , I still think bbc is one of the most trustable news source in the world
14/12/2024, 12:27 - +353 89 605 0161: It's just fact checking themselves is something I think they should be doing more pointedly in their articles.
They fact check plenty of statements like that, saw it all in the lead up to elections. Just hold yourselves to the same standard, build up that trust they're making a fuss about. 
Given what a hard time traditional news outlets are getting recently, it wouldn't be a bad idea.

Globalism is just western imperialism with a thin veneer. The true anti-imperialist force in the world today are the BRICS. They are the true resistance.

20/12/2024, 15:45 - +44 7516 029853: used to have arachnophobia but now love them, especially pseudoscorpions and jumping spiders (however they proven to be harmless in Europe/UK)
20/12/2024, 15:46 - +44 7958 612614: WTF - jumping?
20/12/2024, 15:46 - +44 7516 029853: yes, the cutest ones
20/12/2024, 15:47 - +44 7516 029853: won't post here as someone might have arachnophobia
20/12/2024, 15:47 - +44 7958 612614: hmmm, I’ve recently had dealings with scorpions (actually quite a lot) and I think i’m not scared of them anymore...
20/12/2024, 15:48 - +44 7516 029853: the pseudoscorpions are tiny and absolutely harmless, at least the ones I saw
20/12/2024, 15:49 - +44 7958 612614: it’s not about how dangerous they are - but how they move…

20/12/2024, 17:28 - +44 7958 612614: honey badger, beaver, bobcat, otter….
20/12/2024, 17:48 - +44 7859 903047: You just have to get to know them.
20/12/2024, 17:50 - +44 7859 903047: Animals have way more reason to be concerned about humans

These days people don't spend much time or thought on some personal words to their friends and family, they just copy and paste some random shit and send it on.
So, after all we've been though together this year I want to thank you for your friendship and wish you a happy 2024.
You are the best gymnastics group anyone could ask for.
Best wishes, Helen

27/12/2024, 23:11 - Will-hazzer777: "The Scottish wildcat is a European wildcat (Felis silvestris silvestris) population in Scotland. It was once widely distributed across Great Britain, but the population has declined drastically since the turn of the 20th century due to habitat loss and persecution. It is now limited to northern and eastern Scotland."
 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_wildcat#

Might be one of these? Just a guess...
28/12/2024, 09:51 - +44 7516 029853: Saw a few of them while living in Scotland.

They are extremely beautiful and with a very soft fur.
I even touched one Scottish wildtail, as the cat liked me (though that kitty was a hybrid with a normal domesticated cat)

28/12/2024, 11:19 - onur: some of the sound recordings are low quality
28/12/2024, 11:19 - onur: otherwise it could be nice
28/12/2024, 11:21 - onur: also why "occitan" is a part of the test haha 😅
28/12/2024, 11:21 - onur: and repeats every other question
28/12/2024, 11:21 - onur: jeez
28/12/2024, 11:23 - +44 7516 029853: Yep, I was complaining about that as well.
However,  if someone turns on a crappy recording of a person speaking Romanian, I would still be able to identify it in less than a second.
28/12/2024, 11:23 - onur: i got romanians right too
28/12/2024, 11:25 - onur: i even got the serbian but I cant distinguish occitan and italian or I couldnt understand icelandic

28/12/2024, 13:32 - +44 7859 903047: I guessed 18 correctly. Some of them are pretty difficult to pick out. There are regional differences within countries to begin with, and nearby countries do not always sound that similar
28/12/2024, 13:38 - onur: there was no audio for 2 questions for me, did you experience the same?
28/12/2024, 13:46 - +44 7958 612614: not funny…
28/12/2024, 15:32 - +44 7859 903047: Some of them are a little  hard to hear. I think that was an element of the test, it's supposed to sound like everyday conversation
28/12/2024, 15:35 - onur: no there was like no audio at all

06/01/2025, 11:13 - onur: what surprises me is that she cannot see this as well
06/01/2025, 11:14 - onur: and go above and beyond with some stupid psychological dissect and rant about you can be fat and healthy, just dont mention the mac and cheese you know
06/01/2025, 11:15 - onur: the doctor obviously doesnt care about her "favorite" food
06/01/2025, 11:35 - +353 89 605 0161: It's a pretty poor example for the point I _think_ she's trying to make.

But I do agree that people are too comfortable poking their nose into other people's eating habits.
Someone else's health is none of my business 🤷‍♂
06/01/2025, 11:41 - +353 89 605 0161: But I wish people would stop saying "fat & healthy" when there doesn't seem to be much to back that up.

06/01/2025, 13:57 - +44 7958 612614: It’s interesting… The characters from the Strongest Man competition always pushed this idea of fat people being healthy and fit.  They clearly had an exemplary physical power, but how healthy can it be to carry so much weight and eat an insane number of unhealthy calories?
06/01/2025, 14:01 - +44 7958 612614: You could decide in retrospect and say that if they lived long and maintained good quality of life - that would be the evidence of a healthy life.  Now, there’s a huge element of genes in it - so it’s again statistics that bundles not-same into same categories and clouds the real picture

08/01/2025, 14:39 - onur: but its not a full enjoyment as you think in my understanding
08/01/2025, 14:40 - onur: he cannot be in a good state after spending all his last money and knowing that she wont be interested in her anymore after a while if he cant resupply 😅
08/01/2025, 14:40 - onur: not even mentioning real life needs which require money

You clearly haven't the ability to see things from other people's perspectives.
17/01/2025, 18:02 - Will-hazzer777: You extrapolate these grandiose utopian ideas about society by making significant assumptions that everyone is just like you or can be just like you...

21/01/2025, 15:08 - +353 89 605 0161: Clearly
21/01/2025, 15:08 - onur: have u listened to his actual speech?
21/01/2025, 15:08 - +353 89 605 0161: I didn't say I couldn't see it, just that it boggles my mind 😉 <This message was edited>
21/01/2025, 15:09 - +353 89 605 0161: I don't think he's popular due to his personality.
I'm just surprised that his personality hasn't prevented his popularity
21/01/2025, 15:13 - +44 7958 612614: Yep, his forte is not his personality but something else.  He breaks through normativism with aplomb.  In times when there are no clear solutions - people who dare to do and are seen to be unhurt through actions that should hurt him - are elevated to cult levels because it gives a certain aura of superhuman.
21/01/2025, 15:14 - +44 7958 612614: The same with Trump - rogue elements who take their chances against a much more powerful adversary and win
21/01/2025, 15:15 - +44 7958 612614: On that account, I think he’s got a very strong position.  He’s a role model for billions of disilusioned people that it’s possible to achieve things, that the glass ceiling is not re-enforced concrete, etc…
21/01/2025, 15:16 - +44 7958 612614: but it’s part of the bigger movement where Jordan Peterson also features and many others - its’s the result of the systemic corruption and the need to start anew
21/01/2025, 15:17 - +44 7958 612614: so, even though there are many negative and regressive components of Trumpism and associated social phenomena - it’s not a negative thing in itself - it’s a necessary pathway towards something else
21/01/2025, 15:17 - +44 7958 612614: one can’t tell whether what it leads to will be good, but maybe one that comes after…

21/01/2025, 16:02 - Parag-meetup: Not only stupid , but so insecure 
That’s what makes him volatile
21/01/2025, 16:42 - +44 7599 430972: That’s interesting. So you think Jordan Peterson + Musk + Trump are actually the response to a public mentality momentum raised from corruption and stagnation of left-wing ideology?
21/01/2025, 16:45 - +44 7958 612614: I don’t think anyone creates trends out of nothing - people tap into trends.  A few brave ones start making noise, get punished for it, the resentment goes a notch up and a realisation comes.  Several cycles of this and you eventually get quality leaders that have noticed the trend.
21/01/2025, 16:46 - +44 7958 612614: None of it is risk-free - but that segment that can lead into systemic changes seems to be more intuitive than the rest of population
21/01/2025, 16:47 - +44 7599 430972: That’s an interesting idea. I wonder what left-side thinkers think about JP or Andrew Tate phenomenon
21/01/2025, 16:47 - +44 7958 612614: but yes, this is a reaction to the bankrupt left-wing ideology.  It’s not that the ideology itself is necessarily so bad, but the implementation is definitely corrupt - on so many levels
21/01/2025, 16:51 - +44 7958 612614: specifically - migrations - on the one hand some countries create crisis around the world, it sets off migrants, but countries cannot say NO - neither to the powers causing crisis and to the liberal legacy that stipulates you should take migrants.  It’s a time bomb and it went off.  this is just one example.  I hate to say it- but a lot of stuff that @⁨Will-hazzer777⁩  was going on about is actually valid.  He probably has a particular sensitivity to certain issues that’s shared with grassroots

02/02/2025, 14:00 - +44 7516 029853: yeah
1. it was fun to see ejaculation in 3D
2. Noe is a dumb fuck, but you might like his movies
02/02/2025, 14:04 - +44 7516 029853: what's the point? to confirm that people are suffering and dying while defending the homeland from barbarians, while the most powerful allies are idling as if there is nothing serious happening? not taking in consideration the fact that it could be fake as well 

p.s. just a reminder that I have close friends defending Ukraine
02/02/2025, 14:09 - onur: interesting movie, what's your take on it besides the ejaculation?
02/02/2025, 14:09 - onur: why he is a dumb fuck
02/02/2025, 14:10 - onur: I think he is a good artist :D
02/02/2025, 14:10 - +44 7516 029853: not surprised
02/02/2025, 14:10 - onur: 🤔😅
02/02/2025, 14:11 - onur: I dont know my take on it was that its kind of heartbreaking
02/02/2025, 14:12 - onur: yea it could be fake as well
02/02/2025, 14:12 - +44 7516 029853: it has interesting moments for sure.
but as someone, who watched too many indie movies, I found "Love" to be predictable and repeating the obvious indie clichés (suffering, occasional ejaculation, drugs and smoking while being depressed)
02/02/2025, 14:14 - onur: Idk if he did it on purpose but the movie was allegedly about love, people in it (even background characters) gave their opinion about love but at the end all of them were different and kind of pathetic in their own way so it kinda shows love only exist in ones mind
02/02/2025, 14:15 - onur: and if you are in love you are the loser 😅 (also said by someone in the movie, she only showed in like 2 scenes)
02/02/2025, 14:15 - onur: so I liked it but climax and irreversible were better
02/02/2025, 14:15 - +44 7516 029853: haha
I find it to be the opposite, which contradicts the social norms 😂
02/02/2025, 14:15 - onur: idk why u dont like gaspar noe there arent many people who make real adult movies
02/02/2025, 14:16 - onur: but when u think about it if u love your partner more than they love you it works against you at some point :D
02/02/2025, 14:16 - +44 7516 029853: exactly bcs it's not "real adult movies".

yesterday I had a huge culture shock.
I went to an aerial silks class in Berlin.
in the changing room I had a conversation with a woman who attended the same class.
she was completely naked and felt very comfortable talking to a stranger while being unclothed.
I attended numerous dance classes in London where I obviously had to change clothes, but it never felt that people (women at least) were feeling comfortable being naked even in changing rooms. 

that's, probably, the only good thing I see in Europe so far 💔
02/02/2025, 15:12 - onur: first world problems :D
02/02/2025, 15:13 - +44 7516 029853: but then everyone talks about loneliness, radicalism and declining economics 💅🏻
02/02/2025, 15:15 - onur: if u are pretty and skinny you will feel comfortable being naked xd
02/02/2025, 15:19 - +44 7958 612614: just pretty would do
02/02/2025, 15:20 - onur: nah

02/02/2025, 15:20 - +44 7958 612614: they have a culture of being naked in germany
02/02/2025, 15:20 - +44 7958 612614: their saunas...
02/02/2025, 15:21 - +44 7958 612614: jesus, i knew there was no substance to you...

1. not true, I know many conventionally attractive women and men who are very shy
2. that woman was 30 years older than me, and, if we were to judge by the average standards, she has just a normal body
02/02/2025, 15:44 - onur: 1. i find this hard to believe, they must have something else going on
2. she let it go after that point xd

03/02/2025, 14:40 - onur: it probably means if the system fails pls wait patiently it will get resolved soon
03/02/2025, 14:40 - onur: probably a bad translation
03/02/2025, 14:40 - onur: nice wandering off on a translation error tho xd

03/02/2025, 14:45 - +44 7599 430972: And system is west

03/02/2025, 15:23 - onur: go back to east then there are already lots of failed systems there 😅
03/02/2025, 15:24 - onur: western culture is = humanity and values and philosophy and science and development and debate

03/02/2025, 15:26 - onur: The west could fail many times past 70 years and in each scenario it would be bad for women im sure :D..

nazis and communists can u imagine? u are still whining
03/02/2025, 15:27 - onur: and now its west vs islam, the second strongest "system" competition thinking that communism already failed
03/02/2025, 15:30 - +44 7958 612614: west vs islam?  have you gone green bananas?  It’s democracy vs autocracy and centralism and meritocracy vs social justice (to name some) what’s islam to do with it?
03/02/2025, 15:32 - onur: they arent distinct enough terminologies tbh who represents meritocracy the democrats? they are as corrupt.

Who is democratic? autocrats you mentioned came to power with elections 

everybody is talking about social justice left and right
03/02/2025, 15:32 - onur: if we are talking about "systems" it includes law as well

11/02/2025, 22:53 - +353 89 605 0161: I think 5 or so years ago some younger people decided to start being offended by it.
Deciding that, since it's likely derived from a vulgar term for vulva, it's disparaging to women in particular.

Mid range or foreign accents - makes you sound like a cunt. In most cases NSFW I think.

13/02/2025, 19:09 - +44 7516 029853: there are trips from Boston (Boston Harbor Whale Watching Tours), they do research and take care of the whales while they feed the babies in cold waters due to lack of food in nicer places. 

also, there are whales in San Francisco, they casually hang out near the Golden Gate, which was a pleasant surprise.
13/02/2025, 19:11 - +44 7516 029853: there should be whales in the UK too, I guess, but I saw them only in the United States of Musk

It’s a narrative we tell ourselves to create meaning, offering a sense of continuity and belonging. That’s why people are drawn to nostalgia—it reinforces identity, providing comfort and a connection to something larger than the present moment.

Please can we keep this channel for the purpose of its title. Some of us are trying to escape the depressing news from the _usa+russia vs ukraine_ channel.

I'll give you an example of a _fun meme_ about Jordan Peterson below.

Can we have a separate thread for politics current affairs
OPTION: Yes please, I want this to be a Fun, Pun & Memes group (2 votes)
OPTION: I just love politics in every thread so I don't have fun or be able to talk about philosophy (5 votes)

26/02/2025, 09:42 - Parag-meetup: We have a similar scheme in most counties including UK
26/02/2025, 09:46 - +44 7958 612614: <Media omitted>
26/02/2025, 09:50 - +44 7958 612614: Politics is where civic society meets the state.  That’s how dominant classes pass their views to the dominated class and make them look like they are common sense views.  What’s more fun than that??
26/02/2025, 09:56 - roger🌞🌝: Every time he runs an IRL session Parag invites people to join the chat, and usually quite a few join each week, presumably thinking they will have philosophical chat.
When you talk to the ppl that go to Phil Café one of the most common remarks is that the chat is too full of politics. (And quite frankly not interesting to anyone apart from those posting)
And with regard to this *Fun* thread - this also turns into another political debate. Would be nice to have this as an alternative to the other one.
26/02/2025, 09:59 - Parag-meetup: I don’t envisage it getting enough traction on sub threads .
26/02/2025, 10:02 - roger🌞🌝: More like if you had a sub thread for 'politics & current affairs' would make the main one more user friendly for those that join.
Something similar happened to the rest is history chat that I also that I'm also a member of. They ended up creating a 'politics' thread to keep that chat out of the main thread. <This message was edited>
26/02/2025, 10:03 - +44 7958 612614: I see where you’re coming from and I’ve been in that mental space before - thinking that people don’t engage because there’s something inherently wrong with the group itself (meaning a few characters who are active because we’re the content).  There’s plenty of philosophical themes, but nobody new and outside of the current core interested in engaging.  Let’s experiment - let’s curate the discourse and see how much we need to lower the quality to have people join in.
26/02/2025, 10:06 - +44 7958 612614: What you don’t seem to understand is that less communication - rapidly heading towards zero conversation is not the trend that entices people into joining in.  People are looking for vibrant social settings that offer a wealth of topics - because people are not interested in the same things.  Choreographed meetups where the same old topics are discussed in the same manner with no new insights brought up are intellectually bankrupt.
26/02/2025, 10:07 - roger🌞🌝: Just start a new sub thread for Pol & current affairs and see what happens
The current situation is a handful - perhaps less than 10 people having a conversation amongst themselves, and no real point of entry for newbies.
(Of course anything *I* post on politics is well thought out and considered, I'm just whinging about the stuff other ppl post 😉)
26/02/2025, 10:07 - +44 7958 612614: And I personally think that what’s really good about this group is the people that make it - even the way it’s administered is pretty superb…. There’s almost zero toxicity.
26/02/2025, 10:10 - +44 7958 612614: but what would we be talking about then?  I’ve started a conversation hundred times and tried to get (even) you involved and you’d be like “I’m not an expert on this or that”.  Is it because you want this social arena to play to your strengths?  Why can’t you just relax and engage in non-adversarial manner?
26/02/2025, 10:11 - +44 7958 612614: Orientation towards potentials and possibilities and optimism…
26/02/2025, 10:12 - +44 7958 612614: As opposed to regurgitating old themes and linking to philosophical trivia like it’s a collection of useful trinkets and not a direction of evolving thought
26/02/2025, 10:13 - roger🌞🌝: I'm just reporting on what I'm hearing people say when I go to the IRL meetings.
Personally I find the constant posting of bits in the Guardian quite tiresome, quite a lot of the political discussion is the equivalent of listening to blokes in a pub discussing the England football team and in general I just scroll on a daily basis pass lots of crap messages.
26/02/2025, 10:14 - roger🌞🌝: _philosophical trivia_
Well *this* is the channel for that isn't it?
26/02/2025, 10:15 - +44 7958 612614: but we’re in the middle of a massive political turmoil where a lot of specific worldview certainties have been and are being shattered.  This is THE ONLY TIME WE’LL EVER EXPERIENCE SOMEETHING LIKE THIS AS A REAL TIME LAB EXPERIMENT
26/02/2025, 10:15 - +44 7958 612614: it’s simply incredible the extent of social experimentation at play at the moment
26/02/2025, 10:17 - Parag-meetup: I agree 
Unfortunately it’s an experiment which has been done before a few times , I don’t see the point of it , except as a refresher for those who have forgotten
26/02/2025, 10:19 - +44 7958 612614: I’m more interested in discourse about philosophical topics, study groups, original insights, turning theory into practice… than fact-checking various philosophers from the past that one has no affinity for.  If one does - that’s another matter and one should put forward arguments…
26/02/2025, 10:22 - +44 7958 612614: This is unique and I could tell you why… It’s because there’s no war or revolution involved, it’s because it’s aiming to totally dismantle social structures in a way that almost seems impossible, it’s unique because of the speed at which it’s unrolling - so that we can watch more attentively, it’s very much along the lines of existential philosophy, it’s a liminal period where modernity (or even post-modernity) gives birth to something new…
26/02/2025, 10:24 - +44 7958 612614: but anyway - let’s talk about anything - the problem is - if people who have discourse at the moment are talking about politics (even though I disagree that what we’re talking about is politics -it’s philosophy behind what’s going on) - then you’ll have those people move to the politics chat and the main group will go quiet
26/02/2025, 10:25 - onur: i didnt understand the options
26/02/2025, 10:27 - roger🌞🌝: It was like
1) Yes keep *this* group for fun
2) I don't like fun, and want to have more politics\current affairs on any channel as love talking to my bros
26/02/2025, 10:27 - +44 7958 612614: loaded question
26/02/2025, 10:29 - +44 7958 612614: Why don’t you honestly pose the questions:
Is this group for

Elon: There's a guy who posts on X who's great, Gad Saad...

Rogan: Yeah, he's a friend of mine, been on podcast a bunch of times. 

Elon: Yeah, he's awesome 

Rogan: Yeah he's great

Elon: He talks about suicidal empathy, like if there's so much empathy that you suicide yourself. So we've got civilizational suicidal empathy going on.
I believe in empathy, like I think you should care about other people, but you need to have empathy for civilization as a whole and not commit civilizational suicide;

Rogan: Also don't let someone use your empathy against you so they can completely control your state and then do an insanely bad job of managing it and never get removed. 

Elon: The the fundamental weakness of Western Civilization is empathy, 'the empathy exploit', where they're exploiting a bug in western civilization which is 'the empathy response'.
So, and I think you know, empathy is good but you need to think it through and not just be programmed like a robot.

As such, if conflict did take place between a BRICs member and a NATO member, to what extent would Turkey jeopardize it's financial interests (interests not being catered to by the EU or other NATO members)? What would Turkey gain by holding up it's side of the bargain with the west? Nothing really...

10/03/2025, 14:12 - +44 7958 612614: which is actually clever
10/03/2025, 14:13 - +44 7958 612614: the membership of the NATO automatically puts you in a favourable position (compared to not belong to NATO)…
10/03/2025, 14:13 - Parag-meetup: It also has the largest army in NATO after USA
10/03/2025, 14:13 - Will-hazzer777: It's just a way for their military to gain more real battle ready experience... Turkey still has military service and it's youth population is still relatively large.
10/03/2025, 14:14 - Will-hazzer777: Favourable position for what?
10/03/2025, 14:14 - Will-hazzer777: I agree with that...
10/03/2025, 14:14 - Parag-meetup: Turkey supported  Ukraines bid for NATO 

It’s sent over a billion aid to Ukraine 

It’s offered to send peacekeepers ( its own army ) in Ukraine
10/03/2025, 14:15 - Parag-meetup: For not being attacked
10/03/2025, 14:16 - Will-hazzer777: They might do, but was reluctant to support Sweden's...
10/03/2025, 14:16 - Will-hazzer777: From whom?
10/03/2025, 14:17 - Parag-meetup: Cypress 
Iraq - pkk
Libya - against Russia 
Syrian democratic forces
10/03/2025, 14:17 - Will-hazzer777: Plus, being the second largest defense force in turkey, who exactly going to come to their aid?
10/03/2025, 14:17 - Parag-meetup: Its a busy army
10/03/2025, 14:18 - Parag-meetup: Usa ! And Europe
10/03/2025, 14:18 - Will-hazzer777: NATO only applies to territory that is attacked not personnel.
10/03/2025, 14:18 - +44 7958 612614: Literally everything - there’s a huge temptation to call Turkey names, but the rest of NATO countries have been careful not to...
10/03/2025, 14:18 - Parag-meetup: How is that very difficult
10/03/2025, 14:19 - Parag-meetup: Europe is relying heavily on turkey for Ukraine war
10/03/2025, 14:19 - Will-hazzer777: Like? And how's that going for them?... Have you looked at the Turkish economy and cost of living recently...
10/03/2025, 14:19 - Will-hazzer777: Not going to happen
10/03/2025, 14:19 - +44 7958 612614: It’s a similar position that China has - they want to see the war go away and they don’t take sides….

10/03/2025, 14:20 - Will-hazzer777: Peacekeepers... Not full scale conflict... Quite a different thing.
10/03/2025, 14:20 - Parag-meetup: Shall we put it on the score board again 
It’s like if you guys say it , it has to be wrong 
Easiest game to win
10/03/2025, 14:20 - +44 7958 612614: These things don’t come with guarantees. That’s “social capital” that you were talking about the other day
10/03/2025, 14:20 - Will-hazzer777: And what are they going to get for this exercise? What's in it for them?
10/03/2025, 14:20 - Parag-meetup: Nops 
Very different
10/03/2025, 14:21 - +44 7958 612614: You’re my friend and alll - and I don’t want to hurt your feelings, but, as far as I know, you haven’t got a SINGLE point on that scoreboard…
10/03/2025, 14:21 - Parag-meetup: Not being attacked by Russia or China or cypress or Syria !
10/03/2025, 14:21 - Will-hazzer777: There is no social capital
10/03/2025, 14:21 - Parag-meetup: Last I checked it was like 6-0
10/03/2025, 14:21 - +44 7958 612614: What do you mean??
10/03/2025, 14:21 - Will-hazzer777: They'll have to sort their own shit out... They're the second largest military in NATO.
10/03/2025, 14:22 - Parag-meetup: Anyways , no point arguing with you guys
10/03/2025, 14:22 - Parag-meetup: And you

10/03/2025, 14:23 - Will-hazzer777: Erdogan Warns “Israel” Might Attack Turkey After Palestine and Lebanon

https://al24news.com/en/erdogan-warns-israel-might-attack-turkey-after-palestine-and-lebanon/
10/03/2025, 14:24 - Will-hazzer777: In a war between Turkey and Israel... Will NATO come to Turkey's aid? No.
10/03/2025, 14:24 - +44 7958 612614: Social capital is, for example, what criminal organisations are based on.  Also the relationships between criminal organisation.  Social capital is when Thatcher sent whisky to Pinochet - https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/04/margaret-thatcher-pinochet-chile-scotch-malt-whisky
10/03/2025, 14:24 - Will-hazzer777: That's not what NATO has...
10/03/2025, 14:24 - +44 7958 612614: IMO - NATO would manage the situation and not allow this conflict to progress...
10/03/2025, 14:25 - Will-hazzer777: Fat chance...
10/03/2025, 14:25 - Will-hazzer777: They couldn't fight their way out of a paper bag...
10/03/2025, 14:25 - +44 7958 612614: Relationship between individuals is partially based on social capital.  For example, Trump and Putin, Putin and Xi, Trump and N.K. guy…
10/03/2025, 14:25 - +44 7958 612614: If you look at Europe - there’s very little social capital
10/03/2025, 14:25 - +44 7958 612614: that’s why they are in deep shit
10/03/2025, 14:26 - Will-hazzer777: There's definitely social capital between trump and Putin and Xi and Il...
10/03/2025, 14:26 - +44 7958 612614: I’ve done quite a few presentations on social capital, it’s a very interesting concept - it’s a relationship between 2 people based on trust, love and expectations of reciprocity...
10/03/2025, 14:27 - +44 7958 612614: It forms a normative obligation of exepctations that a service rendered will be returned
10/03/2025, 14:27 - +44 7958 612614: without contracts, etc… - it’s trust and understanding between people and is also a type of friendship...
10/03/2025, 14:27 - Will-hazzer777: But it only holds as long as Trump is president... But western nations are schizophrenic because they're democracies, so alliances built on social capital cant be relied upon long term.
10/03/2025, 14:27 - +44 7958 612614: that’s one of 3 types of capital in society - cultural, social and symbolic capital
10/03/2025, 14:28 - +44 7958 612614: Well, I used the example of Pinochet to prove that this type of capital works even after the power dynamics between parties has changed
10/03/2025, 14:31 - +44 7958 612614: Also, part of what we’re seeing between Trump and Putin (at least I think it is - I find it difficult to get into Trump’s head…) is because of the support that Putin gave to trump during the Putingate...
10/03/2025, 14:31 - +44 7958 612614: Trump is really strangely biased towards Putin - and if it’s not because of personal side of relationship - why otherwise??
10/03/2025, 14:32 - +44 7958 612614: Oh, sozzles - we’re in Fun, Pun and Memes area - @⁨roger🌞🌝⁩ will hate me for this 🙁

America will side with Israel against Turkey...
10/03/2025, 14:45 - +44 7958 612614: I dont’ believe this war will happen - it’s in nobody’s interest.  Maybe after Erdogan, a hot head comes into power and starts something, but Erdogan is too clever for that
10/03/2025, 14:45 - Will-hazzer777: https://allisrael.com/blog/time-to-expel-turkey-from-nato
10/03/2025, 14:46 - Will-hazzer777: Erdogan is a moderate
10/03/2025, 14:47 - +44 7958 612614: Theree’s nothing to stop Erdogan linking up to China, Russia and Iran - so he really has a lot of options.  Almost uniquely positioned to avoid any military threats
10/03/2025, 14:48 - Will-hazzer777: Turkey doesn't get anything out of NATO other than to keep it's opponents in NATO from troubling it. Like you said they hold their tongue... They don't get any real benefits, just a silencing of negatives.
10/03/2025, 14:49 - +44 7958 612614: Lol, is that not a benefit?  Not to mention access to NATO standard weapons
10/03/2025, 14:49 - +44 7958 612614: Turkey would be otherwise a perfect target
10/03/2025, 14:50 - Will-hazzer777: It's like being tolerated as a sister-in-law even though really your in-laws hate you.
10/03/2025, 14:50 - +44 7958 612614: it’s essential though...
10/03/2025, 14:50 - onur: we cant really get them anyways
10/03/2025, 14:51 - Will-hazzer777: Ultimately NATO is a very uneasy family that doesn't work.
10/03/2025, 14:51 - onur: they dont give f35s or that anti misille system
10/03/2025, 14:52 - +44 7958 612614: oh, but didn’t Erdogan buy some S400?
10/03/2025, 14:52 - +44 7958 612614: from Russia
10/03/2025, 14:52 - onur: yeah but they dont work either
10/03/2025, 14:52 - onur: they are incompatible with other older nato stuff

10/03/2025, 14:53 - +44 7958 612614: My feeling is that the Patriot systems are the best …. even though a lot of people would tell you that the Russian system is capable of tracking multiple missiles...

12/03/2025, 15:34 - onur: The Latin term Saraceni is of unknown original meaning. There are claims of it being derived from the Semitic triliteral root šrq "east" and šrkt "tribe, confederation".[9][10] Another possible Semitic root is srq "to steal, rob, thief", more specifically from the noun sāriq (Arabic: سارق), pl. sāriqīn (سارقين), which means "thief, marauder"

13/03/2025, 16:24 - +44 7958 612614: I just need your answer.  I don’t need links to events I’ve heard about.  There’s always someone in teh world committing artrocities - you’ll never be able to identify them as “the one” and fix the problem.  So you have to be managing the problem without getting to these massacres
13/03/2025, 16:25 - +44 7516 029853: "So you have to be managing the massacre without provoking it" - yeah, that's a very logical conclusion.
13/03/2025, 16:26 - +44 7516 029853: "Just don't be beaten up by aggressors, it is that simple"
13/03/2025, 16:26 - +44 7958 612614: We, as modern people, we believe that everything is causal.  Do you agree?  Otherwise, we start believing that masaccres start spontaneously

13/03/2025, 16:36 - +44 7958 612614: Ceasefire, in general, is one of those non-sensical concepts.,  It’s total BS, makes zero sense - the only possible reason for one would be removal of civilian population or securing a nuclear PS?  Otherwise it’s the same stupid thinking along the lines of - we’ll screw them up, while they think we’re thinking about peace....
13/03/2025, 16:40 - +44 7958 612614: I reckon the people sent to negotiate (on the side of the USA) were not smart enough and fell for the demands from Ukraine…. I was quite suprrised with teh suggestion.  Ceasefire???  What’s the point?  “Building cofidence”. Cut the BS...
13/03/2025, 16:42 - +44 7958 612614: Both Russians and Ukrainians are desperate - they both need to agree to terms to stop the war.  American has an amazing purchase on Ukraine, a bit less on Russia, but still - they can work out the deal.  So, why waste everyone’s time with this gradual peace process?  It needs to be agreed, signed and stopped.   Russia doesn’t dictate it, Ukraine even less so - the USA does.
13/03/2025, 16:46 - +44 7516 029853: they already did it multiple times since 2014 (all of them were broken by russia https://kyivindependent.com/neglecting-security-guarantees-trump-fast-tracking-efforts-to-persuade-ukraine-to-ceasefire-with-russia/

Why post here when you already have a place to endlessly discuss politics and economy?

14/03/2025, 09:42 - +44 7599 430972: can you create your own meme group with strict moderation? we had so much fun here before you
14/03/2025, 09:42 - +44 7599 430972: didn’t need any meme policing to begin with

14/03/2025, 09:56 - +44 7958 612614: Also, I wonder if really there’s a scope for setting up a Whatsapp group in the next life.  There might be technological limitations. <This message was edited>

14/03/2025, 14:17 - +44 7958 612614: ok, that’s valid - but depending who does something - it’s called differently...
14/03/2025, 14:17 - +44 7958 612614: it’s always easy to gang up on women, especially women of colour...

14/03/2025, 14:18 - +44 7958 612614: oh, it’s not - they are the most privileged segment of the society  🤣🤣🤣
14/03/2025, 14:18 - Will-hazzer777: That's what Lydia Mugambe might think....
14/03/2025, 14:19 - Will-hazzer777: It's a meme though... Couldn't make it up...
14/03/2025, 14:19 - +44 7958 612614: and where does that privilege come from?  Of course, because they are the most powerful people in the society - black women own everything - all the AI, weapons industries, food production, run car industries... <This message was edited>

14/03/2025, 14:41 - +44 7958 612614: grilled tyres with ketchup and mustard
14/03/2025, 14:41 - Will-hazzer777: Well it's only be whatever I find in your fridge... And if there's not enough, then we'll have to consider alternative protein sources from our host...
14/03/2025, 14:41 - +44 7958 612614: I’m a forager - no fridge, just hung roadkill
14/03/2025, 14:42 - Will-hazzer777: Alternative meat
14/03/2025, 14:42 - +44 7958 612614: rats?  They are not alternative at all - that’s the mainstay of my diet
14/03/2025, 14:42 - +44 7958 612614: anyway, aren’t you a vegan?
14/03/2025, 14:42 - Will-hazzer777: I've not seen your freezer yet...

14/03/2025, 14:43 - Will-hazzer777: I just don't eat dairy... Except a little bit of cheese and no eggs unless theres no alternative.
14/03/2025, 14:44 - +44 7958 612614: no eggs?  I haven’t heard of that yet…. Why not eggs?

17/03/2025, 13:47 - onur: This image is a meme referencing the Broken Window Fallacy, an economic concept popularized by 19th-century French economist Frédéric Bastiat (whose portrait is included in the image).

Explanation of the Joke:
The Broken Window Fallacy: This is the idea that destruction (such as a broken window) stimulates economic activity because someone has to pay for repairs, thereby creating jobs and spending. However, Bastiat argued that this thinking ignores the unseen costs—money spent fixing a window could have been used for more productive purposes, leading to greater overall prosperity.

The "Billions Must Die Gap": The meme applies this concept to a much larger scale, mocking the idea that disasters (wars, pandemics, economic crashes) are beneficial because they spur economic recovery. The gray area represents a major economic downturn caused by mass destruction or loss of life, and the person pointing at the graph (often called the "Wojak NPC" meme) is celebrating the recovery while ignoring the devastating gap caused by the disaster.

The Joke: The blue line represents an alternate timeline where the disaster never happened, showing a smoother, stronger economic trajectory without the suffering. The red line, however, dips dramatically (symbolizing a catastrophe), then climbs up again. The Wojak character is making the flawed argument that the economy recovered quickly, ignoring the fact that the disaster created a massive setback that could have been avoided in the first place.

Bottom Line:
The joke is a satirical criticism of those who view destruction and recovery as economic progress while ignoring the immense suffering and lost potential caused by the downturn in the first place.
17/03/2025, 13:52 - +44 7958 612614: This analysis ignores the psychological side of it - people often become despondent and run out of motivation and optimism as part of the Zeitgeist - the destruction, as per the analogy above, can indeed trigger a capacity that was not there before…
17/03/2025, 13:52 - +44 7958 612614: obviously, not if you present it like a reversal to the baseline 🤣
17/03/2025, 13:54 - onur: but then its not a joke its already what Bastiat said
17/03/2025, 13:55 - onur: for me - I didnt know the guy thats why I didnt understand the meme and thought maybe there are others who dont understand
17/03/2025, 13:56 - onur: what bastiat says makes sense, you can't truly avoid a broken window no matter what you take as precautions :D you won't be able to control all of the circimstances
17/03/2025, 13:57 - onur: given that the window isnt bulletproof or smth for the sake of the analogy 😂
17/03/2025, 13:57 - onur: there is always something which could break the economy because its based on speculation
17/03/2025, 13:57 - onur: there isnt an objective god sent value of things

19/03/2025, 12:56 - onur: for something to be funny I think it needs to be aligned with factual information 😅
19/03/2025, 12:56 - onur: this sounds more like an american who isnt able to distinguish any asian culture
19/03/2025, 12:56 - onur: or doesnt know history at all
19/03/2025, 13:09 - onur: Humor has always fed off reality - tragedy was the first form of storytelling, and comedy evolved from twisting those same tragic elements in unexpected ways. Whether it's exaggeration, irony, or absurd juxtapositions, good humor still relies on a connection to reality.
19/03/2025, 13:10 - onur: 😂😂😂
19/03/2025, 13:11 - onur: is this true 😂
19/03/2025, 13:13 - +353 89 605 0161: Okay fun police 😉
19/03/2025, 13:13 - onur: I want to open humor to discussion
19/03/2025, 13:14 - onur: Not trying to be a fun police 😅
19/03/2025, 13:17 - +44 7958 612614: how would you know if it's factual or not?
19/03/2025, 13:19 - +353 89 605 0161: I guess it needs to be familiar enough for your mind to set up an expectation before the entire joke is delivered and the expectation is subverted.
19/03/2025, 13:24 - onur: Yeah, when I said "factual," I could have just said "familiar" but still factuality/sincerity/actuality is important too.

When the expectation is simply mixing up Chinese and Japanese, it feels more like a 1946 Tom & Jerry episode than a clever subversion of a real situation.

This is the key difference between made-up and sincere stories told by stand-up comedians or Twitter jokes. When you can immediately tell that a "personal" story is fictional, it loses its humor as well.
19/03/2025, 13:25 - onur: at least for me
19/03/2025, 13:29 - +353 89 605 0161: The joke there isn't in mixing up Japan and China it's in the reinterpretation of the video after that discovery.

The expectation is that the person will change their opinion on China once they discover its the source of the video and the joke is that they instead reinterpet the video and now disapprove of it.
19/03/2025, 13:33 - +44 7958 612614: you're weird, so it makes sense
19/03/2025, 13:34 - onur: but its indicating that a lot of people mix them up, otherwise there won't be this situation
19/03/2025, 13:34 - +353 89 605 0161: I agree, it has to be believable else you won't buy into it
19/03/2025, 13:35 - +353 89 605 0161: Yeah, it's a requirement for the joke that you believe people could do that but it's not the _bit_ <This message was edited>
19/03/2025, 13:36 - onur: yeah that's what I mean,

It is true that you might not easily distinguish a Chinese person and a Japanese person but in their cities the aesthetic and the architecture etc are different so it should be telling from the videos especially todays day and age

"Go west, life is peaceful there.
Go west, lots of open air.
Go west to begin life new.
Go west, this is what we'll do.
Go west, sun in winter time.
Go west, we will do just fine.
Go west, where the skies are blue.
Go west, this and more we'll do."

the whole city would turn into a giant advertising banner, covering its best architecture (and it is the best thing the city offers). 
public transport barely functioned due to the increased demand, and mobile coverage in the city centre would collapse—too many people for the infrastructure to handle
31/03/2025, 18:46 - +44 7516 029853: it was fun because I could go to the festivals after work, but the city was absolutely trashed

Away from civilisation and water resources 
It’s just natural fertilizer
08/04/2025, 11:14 - +353 89 605 0161: 158 barrels. Wtf were they eating. Amazing.
08/04/2025, 11:15 - +353 89 605 0161: _If_ the barrels were bio degradable
08/04/2025, 11:15 - Parag-meetup: It’s metal

08/04/2025, 11:38 - +44 7958 612614: It’s a slow release fertiliser

08/04/2025, 14:21 - Will-hazzer777: Why bother jailing him at tax payers expense, just send him back?!
08/04/2025, 14:25 - Parag-meetup: Same reason why they bother jailing the other 132 white British people !
08/04/2025, 14:26 - Will-hazzer777: What you talking about, there's loads more in there.
08/04/2025, 14:40 - Will-hazzer777: If you don't like white men, perhaps consider leaving the country for a destination that has few or none of them in.
08/04/2025, 14:41 - +44 7958 612614: i don't like men at all - what do you suggest i do?
08/04/2025, 14:43 - Will-hazzer777: Become a woman (as far as is possible) and make yourself comfortable in an all women environment...
08/04/2025, 14:44 - +44 7958 612614: i already am comfortable among women , don't mind remaining a man. there are perks
08/04/2025, 14:46 - Will-hazzer777: Well if you don't like me and don't like being in their company, then the closest man to you is yourself....you have to start there...
08/04/2025, 14:48 - Parag-meetup: I don’t like men in general

08/04/2025, 14:50 - Will-hazzer777: Then again, make yourself a woman as far as possible... You need to cut it off..

08/04/2025, 14:51 - +44 7958 612614: bring it out in the open
08/04/2025, 14:51 - +44 7958 612614: honestly is the best option
08/04/2025, 14:51 - +44 7958 612614: honesty
08/04/2025, 14:51 - Will-hazzer777: After the chop chop
08/04/2025, 14:51 - +44 7958 612614: don't do it! you'll regret

10/04/2025, 09:49 - Parag-meetup: So he won’t be going on a killing and raping spree , and probably reads lot and come up with cure of some diseases
10/04/2025, 09:49 - +44 7599 430972: Not a cure to testosterone deficiency it seems
10/04/2025, 09:50 - Parag-meetup: That’s the aim 
Why would we wanna cure it ?
10/04/2025, 09:53 - +44 7599 430972: A lot of reasons, from looking like a minger to being terrible and sex and just a bore in general
10/04/2025, 09:56 - +44 7599 430972: Also less likely to be a serial killer or a pervert
10/04/2025, 09:58 - Parag-meetup: Looks are subjective , being terrible is usually a case of high testosterone 
Terrible at sex , again is subjective 
Bore , objectively is a trait of high  testosterone
10/04/2025, 09:58 - Parag-meetup: Yes less testosterone , less likely
10/04/2025, 09:58 - +44 7599 430972: Any proof?
10/04/2025, 10:14 - +44 7958 612614: Yeah, exactly - the lack of testosterone can doo all those things to you…
10/04/2025, 10:15 - +44 7599 430972: Unironically yes!

10/04/2025, 12:05 - +44 7958 612614: Is stationary phone better at taking photos?
10/04/2025, 12:08 - +44 7599 430972: Yes because less hand shaking

12/04/2025, 09:41 - +91 80720 44735: But let's not forget to look behind the curtain and ask the question, 'Why is America the land of the immigrants? What's in its DNA?' - My answer? America is a settler-colonialist project, and they desperately needed White Men from Europe to overcome the Natives not just through superior technology like guns, but through raw numbers and 'settle' the country - 'The Welcome' was never too long lasting, nor was it for everyone - In the 1900s, Italian Americans were not considered 'White'... Also look up the 'Chinese Exclusion Act'
12/04/2025, 09:42 - +91 80720 44735: In more recent times, my 2 cents as to why America welcomed refugees, especially from Cuba or such countries behind the Iron Curtain, was to 'feel superior' during the Cold War - because if people from those countries were desperate to come over to your side, your side must have something, be intellectually and morally superior, so you felt good about yourself
12/04/2025, 09:43 - +91 80720 44735: I woke up on the cynic side of my bed today 🤣
12/04/2025, 09:48 - +91 80720 44735: And just to complete my cynical quota - this was probably true because of the alcohol tolerance developed by repeated drinking 🤷‍♂
12/04/2025, 09:50 - +91 80720 44735: And why did Europeans drink so much wine in those days? Because safe drinking water was inaccessible to the general population, and wine was safer to drink than impure water (bacteria cannot grow easily in wine) https://newhistories.sites.sheffield.ac.uk/volumes/2018-19/volume-8/the-medieval-beverage-of-choice-alcohol-or-water
12/04/2025, 09:53 - Parag-meetup: The welcome was easily there till even 2002 
The really change started only after 2008

Any radically different ideology , philosophicaly would obviously be tolerated , say communism or radical Islam . 

Also distinctive culture could annoy others when they enchoah on others 

But the overall sentiment was that if you work hard , contributing to America you are part of the machine
12/04/2025, 09:54 - +91 80720 44735: That wave of welcome was for highly specialized talent in math and science, because their computer and tech industries needed huge labor pools and their universities couldn't produce as many skilled as required
12/04/2025, 09:55 - +91 80720 44735: Of course, doctors are always welcome, basically anywhere in the world 😇
12/04/2025, 09:55 - +91 80720 44735: Only, you have to re-qualify, not an easy ask
12/04/2025, 09:56 - Parag-meetup: What I’m pointing to is that , you will be welcomed if you are contributing to the home ( if you are a burden in my home , obviously you are a problem ) 

But you didn’t have to adopt a particular set of lifestyle as you do in France or Germany or England and have an inherent bias toward your ancestral structure . Instead if you are free thinking you are as much a part of America , at least for all whites
12/04/2025, 09:58 - +91 80720 44735: But my argument is, 'everybody contributes' - do you think the stadium audience doesn't contribute to the Baseball game? They absolutely do! I have personally spoken to so many players who say that audience encouragement made them perform literally miracles, do things they never thought they could do
12/04/2025, 09:58 - +91 80720 44735: So measuring 'contribution' is a short-term thinking - everybody contributes in their own way, big or small is a temporal measurement
12/04/2025, 09:59 - Parag-meetup: I’m sure a person travelling to America with a suicide bomb vest , isn’t thinking of contributing
12/04/2025, 09:59 - Parag-meetup: No 
You can be a net contributor or extracted
12/04/2025, 10:00 - +91 80720 44735: Contributing by creating jobs at DHS and CIA 😜🤣
12/04/2025, 10:01 - Parag-meetup: False economy
12/04/2025, 10:01 - +91 80720 44735: As all economies are
12/04/2025, 10:02 - +91 80720 44735: Do you think the social media economy is a 'real economy'?
12/04/2025, 10:02 - +91 80720 44735: What about jobs created by war?
12/04/2025, 10:02 - +91 80720 44735: Terrorism is, in my view, a subsect of war, a tactic of asymmetric warfare
12/04/2025, 10:02 - +91 80720 44735: George Washington was a 'terrorist', if you ask King George
12/04/2025, 10:03 - Parag-meetup: What’s with the what about Ian
12/04/2025, 10:03 - Parag-meetup: What aboutism
12/04/2025, 10:03 - +91 80720 44735: I'm just pointing out that most of our jobs today are 'manufactured', contrived
12/04/2025, 10:03 - +91 80720 44735: Do we really need a 'personal shopper', a 'life coach'?
12/04/2025, 10:04 - Parag-meetup: Even if most are ( which aren’t ) doesn’t prove that what you said is right
12/04/2025, 10:04 - +91 80720 44735: But 50 years ago, we could have asked, 'Do we really need a maid to clean and cook?'
12/04/2025, 10:04 - Parag-meetup: That’s what aboutism fallacy
12/04/2025, 10:04 - Parag-meetup: Avoid if
12/04/2025, 10:04 - Parag-meetup: Yes for the state of Britain 
It was a net loss
12/04/2025, 10:04 - +91 80720 44735: It cuts both ways - when I say 'everybody contributes', you went, 'what about a terrorist?'
12/04/2025, 10:05 - Parag-meetup: Yes 
That’s proved your point wrong 
Everyone does not contribute
12/04/2025, 10:06 - Parag-meetup: When you say everyone ans I prove there is at least one who doesn’t , your point is nullified
12/04/2025, 10:06 - Parag-meetup: If you say no one contributes and I prove one does then your point is lost
12/04/2025, 10:06 - +91 80720 44735: Well, I don't accept your premise that DHS and CIA are 'false jobs'
12/04/2025, 10:07 - +91 80720 44735: Are policemen and firemen 'false jobs' too?
12/04/2025, 10:07 - +91 80720 44735: All enforcement is optional - if everybody followed the rules, we wouldn't need any of them
12/04/2025, 10:07 - Parag-meetup: So you are sticking to your guns that all people contribute positively to the country
12/04/2025, 10:08 - +91 80720 44735: It's my opinion, yes, but like I said, I take a broader, longer-term view
12/04/2025, 10:08 - Parag-meetup: Sorry , so if I come to blow 200 people up to your country , and do that , how was I a positive contributor to your country
12/04/2025, 10:09 - +91 80720 44735: Of course, this is an academic discussion, I don't support violence and terrorism
12/04/2025, 10:09 - +91 80720 44735: But all wars create jobs, including terrorism
12/04/2025, 10:09 - +91 80720 44735: Russian economy today is a war economy
12/04/2025, 10:10 - Parag-meetup: You said that they create jobs for DHS

it’s like saying I keep spilling milk and someone has to clean it up 

If half of the people spilled it 24/7 and the other cleaned it up 24/7 , they are effectively doing a job and creating a job 

But in about 37 hours , all of them will die of hunger , fatigue and exhaustion
12/04/2025, 10:11 - Parag-meetup: Yes and I’m sayin job creation is not a goal 
Wealth creation is
12/04/2025, 10:11 - Parag-meetup: That’s why the false economy <This message was edited>
12/04/2025, 10:11 - Parag-meetup: And bullshit jobs <This message was edited>
12/04/2025, 10:12 - +91 80720 44735: I was reading an interesting paper that said basically, the bursting of the housing bubble which happened in 2008 would have happened in 2004, but for the economic stimulus given by George W Bush in the form of the Afghan and Iraq war
12/04/2025, 10:13 - +91 80720 44735: That's assuming we run out of milk - remember how the US destroyed thousands of tons of wheat during the Great Depression, because the prices collapsed? The US Govt. literally paid farmers to set fire to their crops, and then next year, they grew them again!
12/04/2025, 10:14 - Parag-meetup: That’s just saying if I make things more complex , so try you can’t see clearly and at the individual components , and I can’t point out to what’s bad , then it’s not bad
12/04/2025, 10:14 - +91 80720 44735: Wealth is arbit, imho - we dig out more gold every year from the Earth, so what? As a planetary species, do we have aliens to show off to?
12/04/2025, 10:14 - Parag-meetup: Is that your answer ?
12/04/2025, 10:14 - Parag-meetup: Gold is not wealth
12/04/2025, 10:15 - +91 80720 44735: A lot of our economy consists of things like this - we give Subsidies to BP to dig up oil, and then when there's a spill, we pay to cleanup - why not regulate and prevent the drilling in dangerous areas in the first place?
12/04/2025, 10:15 - Parag-meetup: Wealth is the ease and security of life
12/04/2025, 10:16 - +91 80720 44735: Another example - China recently *demolished* thousands of apartment towers, rather than fund their completion, to 'clear up bad debt' and 'oversupply', and now that the balance sheets are clean, they're lending once again to new housing construction!!!
12/04/2025, 10:16 - Parag-meetup: Again you are trying to state some complex subjects , which I can talk about and point out why they are wrong , but will shift the focus elsewhere
12/04/2025, 10:16 - +91 80720 44735: I'm giving examples of 'contrived jobs'
12/04/2025, 10:17 - Parag-meetup: It’s a common tactic used when you don’t have answers to simple questions
12/04/2025, 10:17 - +91 80720 44735: Where we *know* we're doing something that we might have to undo and redo, and then we create jobs all around
12/04/2025, 10:17 - Parag-meetup: Also this is more a fun and memes section
12/04/2025, 10:17 - +91 80720 44735: Sorry
12/04/2025, 10:17 - Parag-meetup: We can discuss more about this in the main group
12/04/2025, 10:17 - Parag-meetup: Ya or bullshit jobs
12/04/2025, 10:17 - +91 80720 44735: The main group is stuck in NHS, I have no idea about that topic lol
12/04/2025, 10:18 - Parag-meetup: You can always change the topic

13/04/2025, 21:23 - +91 80720 44735: Eerily similar - In Indian mythology, the 'Good Gods' are called 'Devas', and the Bad Guys, 'The Asuras' - like, the entire Ramayana is about the Devas under Lord Ram beating / killing the Asuras, led by 'Demon King' Raavan (10-headed one)... And today, you will find that the East of India and those in Sri Lanka refer to themselves as 'Asura People', and have temples idolizing 'Asura Gods' like Raavan! To my mind, it brings the fact that every religion absolutely *needs* an 'other' to exist, an 'evil' that the religion can claim to cure, or stand against, and if there is none, they simply create or scapegoat a people in order to further their religion!!!

Experts warn against overuse of seed and vegetable oils, citing concerns about inflammation and a potential link to aggressive breast cancer. New research from Weill Cornell Medicine suggests that linoleic acid, a fat found in these oils, may promote the growth of breast cancer cells."

21/04/2025, 08:27 - +44 7599 430972: You need conflicting evidence to disprove that

21/04/2025, 08:29 - +44 7599 430972: Just to make it worse, Parag paraphrased the comment and added poor punctuation so you couldn’t trace it by reverse search to the original thread

13/05/2025, 17:03 - +44 7889 480662: That was like me yesterday when I saw this person who had created hand drawn comics to do with the lord of the Ring series and one of them had a set where legolas had came to see older man Bilbo baggins and it was truly a wholesome situation and I commented something severely wholesome on the pictures because they touched me so well

14/05/2025, 13:23 - onur: The proportions look weird
14/05/2025, 13:23 - onur: Gladius looks like a greatsword here but its a shortsword
14/05/2025, 13:25 - onur: Probably the best among them is a claymore
14/05/2025, 13:27 - +44 7931 159803: That’s my birth month!

14/05/2025, 14:01 - +44 7516 029853: not proud about that, but mine is Indian khanda too
14/05/2025, 14:02 - +44 7889 480662: Why wouldn't you be proud of it?
14/05/2025, 14:03 - +44 7516 029853: I prefer claymore or urumi. flamberg is cool too
14/05/2025, 14:06 - +44 7889 480662: I mean I can agree with you with the claymore and flamberg
14/05/2025, 15:05 - Parag-meetup: https://www.instagram.com/reel/DJmyKg-u6WE/?igsh=MW91cHpmemNlcG9qdA==
14/05/2025, 15:47 - onur: Why would u be
14/05/2025, 15:50 - +44 7889 480662: Because I love all cultures myself so to see I am a beautiful Indian blade is always going to be something wonderful to me
14/05/2025, 15:51 - onur: U sure u love ALL cultures?
14/05/2025, 15:51 - +44 7889 480662: Yes?
14/05/2025, 15:52 - onur: How come
14/05/2025, 15:52 - +44 7889 480662: What's with the integration
14/05/2025, 15:52 - onur: There are cultures which hold values contradicting with each other
14/05/2025, 15:52 - onur: Loving all of them is impossible
14/05/2025, 15:52 - onur: Its philosophy
14/05/2025, 15:52 - +44 7889 480662: Well that's on you if you believe things can be impossible I don't
14/05/2025, 15:53 - onur: I am questioning your beliefs
14/05/2025, 15:53 - +44 7889 480662: It's not beliefs it's fascination
14/05/2025, 15:55 - +44 7889 480662: I'm fascinated by the mechanics of many different cultures and how they work and how they mix together it's a beautiful thing when you think about it
14/05/2025, 15:55 - onur: If you are for gender equality there are many cultures which strictly enforce gender norms or there are radical views on punishment and rights etc
14/05/2025, 15:55 - +44 7889 480662: Just because I don't agree with everything they do does not mean I can't love the cultures for what they are
14/05/2025, 15:56 - +44 7889 480662: The fact that you say you love and our fascinated by something does not mean you cannot see the pros and cons of cultures to think that is close-minded
14/05/2025, 15:56 - onur: Whats there to love about a close minded culture
14/05/2025, 15:56 - +44 7889 480662: You're not exactly giving me an example of one culture you think I shouldn't like maybe give me one and I may give you the reasons why I like the culture
14/05/2025, 15:57 - onur: We can continue with indian culture
14/05/2025, 15:57 - +44 7889 480662: The history they're building their foods that culture of considering cows sacred and how they will not damage a cow because it is considered their secret ancestors that is one thing I love about India
14/05/2025, 15:57 - +44 7889 480662: Not to mention that architecture is on levels that I can't even compare to most things in the UK
14/05/2025, 15:59 - onur: But its leading to eating cow dung and bathing on cow piss 

Most of the indian food in india would send you gastro ER 

Architecture built on slaves back and their literal bodies
14/05/2025, 15:59 - +44 7889 480662: You're only looking at the negative parts of India why are you only looking at the negative why don't you look at the beautiful
14/05/2025, 16:00 - +44 7889 480662: You think I care about any of those things and that's where your problem lies maybe look at the more beautiful parts of something rather than looking at the bad parts because that makes you a nihilist
14/05/2025, 16:00 - onur: I can see the beauty but it doesnt necessarily about indian culture even a broken clock shows true time twice a day
14/05/2025, 16:00 - +44 7889 480662: Yes it does food is part of the culture architecture is part of the culture their religions are part of the culture
14/05/2025, 16:00 - +44 7889 480662: I care about the beauty of the place I don't always care about the horrible things stop being a nilhist people may like you better that way
14/05/2025, 16:01 - onur: Even indians dont love indian culture and trying to escape from country so it felt forced
14/05/2025, 16:01 - onur: 🤣
14/05/2025, 16:01 - +44 7889 480662: Well that's on them I'm not Indian am I
14/05/2025, 16:01 - +44 7889 480662: A philosopher should have an open mind and be able to love things about everything and be able to question about the things they do not when I look at you I don't see her philosopher I see it person that is only looking at the darker elements of everything

16/05/2025, 18:07 - +44 7516 029853: blaming everything on immigration, obviously.

there was a chilling saying in the Soviet Union:
“If there’s no water in the tap, it means the Jews have drunk it.”
(it rhymes in Russian and sounds almost cheerful, despite its sinister implication)
16/05/2025, 18:18 - Will-hazzer777: Well that's just silly. The soviet union is a huge landmass and has a tiny population relative to its size.

Britain is tiny and has a huge population relative to its size.

Go figure.
16/05/2025, 18:19 - +44 7889 480662: Who had believed that the Russians were just as anti-semitic as the Germans
16/05/2025, 18:20 - Parag-meetup: As compared to each other ? 
That’s no metric 
How much land per person is too dense ?
16/05/2025, 18:22 - +44 7889 480662: I mean if your comparing India which is a lot smaller than Russia in a a way Russia is massive but more empty and baron places India is a densely over populated place but less space to put them all
16/05/2025, 18:27 - Will-hazzer777: You clearly think that India was too dense...
16/05/2025, 18:28 - +44 7889 480662: No I don't think that that is not what I'm saying
16/05/2025, 18:28 - Will-hazzer777: Am I talking to you?
16/05/2025, 18:29 - +44 7889 480662: But I was the one that brought up India no one else has brought out other than me so why would you bring someone else up it's kind of wasting time isn't it
16/05/2025, 18:29 - Will-hazzer777: I had a similar but different thought before I read your statement. Is that impossible to believe?
16/05/2025, 18:30 - +44 7889 480662: I'm not like you I don't believe things can be impossible I believe anything can be done if you try hard enough but from reading the past conversation you didn't bring up anything to do of India so yeah
16/05/2025, 18:30 - Will-hazzer777: It was a rhetorical question.
16/05/2025, 18:31 - +44 7889 480662: Actually know it wasn't a rhetorical question you specifically asked a question that had an answer rhetorical questions haven't got answers to them
16/05/2025, 18:31 - +44 7889 480662: No
16/05/2025, 18:31 - +44 7889 480662: Goodness you will never admit when your wrong will you
16/05/2025, 18:32 - Will-hazzer777: Well let me clarify, my question was rhetorical. I wasn't looking for a philosophical answer to it, but thanks, much appreciated.
16/05/2025, 18:32 - +44 7889 480662: You're in a philosophical group and you wasn't looking for a philosophical answer are you going to go traveling and not see anything just stay in the hotel room
16/05/2025, 18:33 - +44 7889 480662: No? If you're not looking for philosophical then get out of the group because this group is four philosophical people nothing else nothing more
16/05/2025, 18:36 - Will-hazzer777: It's a 'fun pun and memes' group technically.
16/05/2025, 18:36 - +44 7889 480662: In a philosophical group that's what this is and plus what you're doing isn't considered as funny or memes either
16/05/2025, 18:36 - Will-hazzer777: Well I thought the article I posted was rather funny tbh.
16/05/2025, 18:36 - +44 7889 480662: This part of the group should not be sharing anything political or serious if we go by your logic
16/05/2025, 18:37 - Will-hazzer777: I'm easy going... You'll have to ask @⁨Parag-meetup⁩ about the rules for this particular page.

How much land area per person is ok ?
16/05/2025, 18:38 - +44 7889 480662: That's not a meme or funny topic hazzer is going to get salty because that's neither funny nor me worthy
16/05/2025, 18:39 - Will-hazzer777: Like I said, I'm the easy going one.... You were trying to lay down the law on me earlier...
16/05/2025, 18:39 - +44 7889 480662: I didn't try I succeeded

16/05/2025, 18:41 - Will-hazzer777: Kind of... They're all sort of loosely connected groups.
16/05/2025, 18:41 - +44 7889 480662: No it is dont dance around the subject that's pathetic and cowardly
16/05/2025, 18:41 - Will-hazzer777: What music would like to dance to?
16/05/2025, 18:41 - +44 7889 480662: And btw your easy going? Since when?
16/05/2025, 18:42 - Will-hazzer777: I'm not the one laying down laws...
16/05/2025, 18:42 - +44 7889 480662: You are one of the least easy going in this whole four part group
16/05/2025, 18:43 - +44 7889 480662: I think you need a reality check and need a long session of counciling because you are anything but easy going
16/05/2025, 18:43 - Will-hazzer777: Either way, my comment wasn't to you.
16/05/2025, 18:43 - +44 7889 480662: And I don't give a fuck
16/05/2025, 18:43 - Will-hazzer777: Takes one to know one.
16/05/2025, 18:44 - +44 7889 480662: But your the one who brings up serious political shit in a funny meme group then when they're called to serious you back peddle and say I'm not looking for philosophical answers you hypocritical moron

16/05/2025, 18:50 - onur: I don't hate india but I don't love it like yourself
16/05/2025, 18:50 - onur: what about it
16/05/2025, 18:51 - +44 7889 480662: No you said even India's hate their own culture so you was implying you hate it aswell

16/05/2025, 18:54 - +44 7889 480662: Because unlike you when I show hatred I actually am honest about it it's only someone with an over inflated ego cannot admit when speak hatred just like hazzer
16/05/2025, 18:55 - onur: parag is Indian hazzar is Indian descent we are friends

16/05/2025, 19:12 - +44 7889 480662: Right and wrong are subjective terms

17/05/2025, 11:03 - Will-hazzer777: It was quite reasonable to admit these things when the government in power in Zimbabwe is hostile to elite interest groups in the west, but not willing to admit this when money is being made by western elites in South Africa and they don't want relations to turn sour. So it's easy to deny things and turn a blind eye.
17/05/2025, 11:03 - +44 7889 480662: When it comes to that guy I'm not surprised it's talking about genocide of any kind mister I did the Nazi salute and then pretended I didn't
17/05/2025, 11:14 - Will-hazzer777: Many British Asians I think can quite relate to the threat as many have family histories of a need to flee places in Africa like Uganda due to the threat to their lives and property during the rule of autocrats like Idi Amin.

21/05/2025, 16:35 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: A 2012 study published in _Scientific Reports_ by Serra _et al_ analyzed half a million pop songs from 1955 to 2010 they found that modern music has:
- less melodic variation 
- less chord progression
- increased loudness 
- less timbral diversity
 this suggests that older music was richer in structure while modern music tends to follow more formulaic patterns

24/05/2025, 20:48 - +44 7958 612614: what you’re missing is trends - if we were becoming more liberal and more equitable society over the last - let’s say 60 years and then the trend buckles and it starts going in another direction - you’ll be quoting those 60 years as statistically more significant proof that things are getting better?  It’s all about trend sentiment - where things are going from now, not whether it’s better than 100 years ago..  Again, missing the point (and trends) <This message was edited>

25/05/2025, 18:48 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: The philosopher Joseph Scheiber coined the expression "Nietzsche Thesis": where he argued that the "goal of most conversations is not about seeking the truth but about self-preservation" (explains conspiracies, rise of populists, ...some heated discussions 😉) in other words ...most people will accept or reject a fact based upon calculation, rather than any concern for the truth .... conversely, we are resistant to potentially harmful or destructive truth... we do not have any meaningful concern for the truth but only our well-being. 

Trump has exploited a fundamental human weakness. 

I wonder how many are aware of this, or know how to deal with it.
25/05/2025, 18:52 - +44 7889 480662: That is actually a very interesting way of looking at that to be fair it's like the fact that some people believe you only do good things for people because the end goal is you're getting something out of them in the long run it's kind of the same way of looking at things in my opinion
25/05/2025, 19:01 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: Its been a puzzle for me..."people's choice"... in many recent events. 
only thing that I can accept is that nobody cares about the truth (as a human trait). if it does not serve our interests... we ignore it. 

There is therefore a very high chance of strongmen changing  the landscape in the next decade.
25/05/2025, 19:02 - +44 7889 480662: I mean I care truly about the truth I don't really understand those people that try to say that ignorance is bliss no ignorance his house society keeps you pacified
25/05/2025, 19:04 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: This is not about knowledge versus ignorance.

29/05/2025, 16:21 - +44 7889 480662: So basically you could have gotten done for possession because you're only allowed seven grams
29/05/2025, 16:21 - onur: Yeah it was saying possesion of class b drugs
29/05/2025, 16:22 - onur: I dont know tbh
29/05/2025, 16:22 - onur: I used to do it all the time, that time I didnt hide it properly
29/05/2025, 16:22 - onur: The warning I mean
29/05/2025, 16:31 - +44 7958 612614: IN Europe you often have dogs right next to the border control
29/05/2025, 16:33 - +44 7889 480662: If you ask me it seems like you became too confident and complacent that you was not going to get caught for what you did
29/05/2025, 17:06 - onur: Yeah exactly
29/05/2025, 17:06 - +44 7889 480662: That's human huberus right there 😂
29/05/2025, 17:06 - onur: I know it happens with job hunting as well
29/05/2025, 17:07 - onur: One shouldnt fall into hope and stop looking
29/05/2025, 17:07 - onur: ;D
29/05/2025, 17:07 - onur: I mean when you get an interveiw
29/05/2025, 17:07 - +44 7889 480662: Sadly sometimes hope is all we have when times get most bleak
29/05/2025, 17:07 - onur: It can give a wrong sense of security
29/05/2025, 17:08 - onur: Thats all im saying
29/05/2025, 17:08 - onur: Like im going to have this final interview tomorrow and i got 2 more new interviews lined up next week so i kind of stopped applying
29/05/2025, 17:08 - onur: But to maximize my chances i should keep looking
29/05/2025, 17:09 - onur: But i falsely feel like I landed a job
29/05/2025, 17:09 - onur: Its dangerous 😅
29/05/2025, 17:10 - +44 7958 612614: Yep, so easy to fall for that - but we don’t have inexhaustible motivation for boring and stressful things
29/05/2025, 17:10 - onur: Bro
29/05/2025, 17:11 - onur: I am having stomach aches
29/05/2025, 17:11 - onur: I hope this is over soon ;D
29/05/2025, 17:11 - +44 7958 612614: inshallah
29/05/2025, 17:11 - onur: I already sent the task yesterday and tomorrow is going to be a competency based interview + a passion presentation
29/05/2025, 17:11 - onur: I picked brutalism :D
29/05/2025, 17:16 - +44 7958 612614: oh, fuck - that will challenge you.  I mean - both competency and passion
29/05/2025, 17:17 - +44 7958 612614: what do you mean?  Brutalism as in architecture?
29/05/2025, 17:17 - onur: Yeahh
29/05/2025, 17:17 - onur: Ikr
29/05/2025, 17:17 - onur: + there was a task
29/05/2025, 17:17 - onur: Like wtf
29/05/2025, 17:17 - +44 7958 612614: but you’re applying for a job as a researcher?
29/05/2025, 17:18 - onur: Research manager yeah
29/05/2025, 17:18 - onur: The task was related to the job
29/05/2025, 17:18 - +44 7958 612614: Have you seen Forest Gump?
29/05/2025, 17:18 - onur: The passion presentation is like 5 mins only
29/05/2025, 17:18 - onur: Yeah
29/05/2025, 17:18 - +44 7958 612614: Anyway, best of luck!  I’ll be chuffed if you got it!
29/05/2025, 17:19 - onur: In this economy and political climate
29/05/2025, 17:19 - onur: Me too buddy
29/05/2025, 17:19 - +44 7958 612614: Drinks on me in celebration!
29/05/2025, 17:20 - onur: You bet
29/05/2025, 17:20 - onur: 🥳
29/05/2025, 17:25 - +44 7889 480662: Forrest gump is one of those movies that I feel like everyone needs to watch at one point it's one of those movies that really explains identity of people and how one person can go so far in life

30/05/2025, 14:55 - +44 7889 480662: I swear this reminds me of the Boston marathon incident but now when the UK instead of in the US
30/05/2025, 14:57 - Will-hazzer777: I'm not quite sure how... The Boston marathon was premeditated.
30/05/2025, 14:57 - +44 7889 480662: I very much doubt that to be quite honest
30/05/2025, 14:57 - +44 7889 480662: The Boston marathon attack was definitely something that was intentional
30/05/2025, 14:58 - Parag-meetup: Go enjoy Belfast
30/05/2025, 14:58 - +44 7889 480662: What's that got to do with anything
30/05/2025, 14:58 - +44 7516 029853: the terrorists at the Boston marathon were a Muslim ethnic minority from russia, to be fair
30/05/2025, 14:59 - +44 7889 480662: Hearing those two things in the same response really whack my mind out to be fair Muslims from Russia last time I checked Russia didn't allow people to worship their own deities
30/05/2025, 15:00 - +44 7516 029853: yeah, they are in one hand kill and annex these terrorises, on the other hand those same oppressed people are among the majority who willingly go to Ukraine to commit horrible war crimes
30/05/2025, 15:00 - Will-hazzer777: I am enjoying thanks.
30/05/2025, 15:01 - +44 7889 480662: Did you say that because you think that Belfast is to do with the IRA?
30/05/2025, 15:01 - +44 7889 480662: I mean Russia is one of those countries that you can honestly feel sorry for at the same time as hating them to existence and back I mean think about it they're one of the countries that have never known the freedoms that we have in the United Kingdom
30/05/2025, 15:06 - +44 7516 029853: yeah 
the UK doesn't seem to be a perfect country, especially while living there, but the moment one leaves the UK, it becomes quite clear that it's actually quite a good, functional country
30/05/2025, 15:06 - +44 7889 480662: That's why I'm saying when it comes to all these people that are complaining and that their life in the United Kingdom is so bad I say go to a more oppressed country and say that when you can't even complain about your own government without literally having a gun point into your fucking face then tell me it's a fucking awful place
30/05/2025, 15:09 - +44 7516 029853: most likely they are just IT people, who used to live in poor countries where when working in IT you earn like a king (or a queen). 
the salary difference isn't that huge in the IT sector in the UK, thus the privilege is lost which leads to the constant complaints
30/05/2025, 15:12 - +353 89 605 0161: Or they're comparing the UK to what they imagine it _could_ be rather than just other "worse" countries.

Other worse alternatives existing isn't much of a defence for a given condition I'd say
30/05/2025, 15:16 - +44 7516 029853: also true.
based on many British movies and TV series everyone lives in mansions, drinks tea with a splash of milk and studies/studied at Cambridge/Oxford.

but at the same time the vast majority of the American movies are based on relatively stable white, middle/upper middle class, which also creates a cute picture of the country which doesn't exist in real life
30/05/2025, 15:18 - +353 89 605 0161: Doesn't Russia have Islam as one of its "traditional religions" in its law? 
I don't know the intricacies but I'm pretty sure you can practice Islam in Russia. <This message was edited>
30/05/2025, 15:18 - +44 7889 480662: To be honest the only things I can think of when it comes to shows like that is the crown Downton abbey and Victoria
30/05/2025, 15:18 - +44 7889 480662: And I think that Russia does have its own cultures to be fair I mean we are literally talking about one of the oldest countries in the world seeing as their history before unionation was Slavic
30/05/2025, 15:19 - +353 89 605 0161: That is true.
There are only two types of Brits.
Aristocrats and east end gangsters.

The rest of the pop are invaders.
30/05/2025, 15:21 - onur: Whats love got to do with it
30/05/2025, 15:21 - +44 7516 029853: every religion is under a very strict control there but yeah, you can still practice Islam even nowadays afaik.

they focus on oppression of the culture and language(s)of the minorities.
30/05/2025, 15:21 - +44 7889 480662: I didn't mention love in any of my messages so why reply with this I just want to know why they brought up Ireland all of a sudden
30/05/2025, 15:22 - +44 7516 029853: I guess love is everywhere 🥲
30/05/2025, 15:22 - onur: Hmm
30/05/2025, 15:22 - onur: Its a lyric
30/05/2025, 15:23 - onur: The way you phrased it made me think of this song
30/05/2025, 15:23 - onur: Hahahha

02/06/2025, 17:54 - +44 7859 903047: The communities that live in Chechnya and Dagestan (who are Muslim) are not very pro Russian. In fact they have faced suppression. Russia in theory tolerates other religions but not in practice
02/06/2025, 18:01 - Will-hazzer777: The same is true with all civilisations, religions and groups with eachother once their mutually incompatible value systems clash... It's easy to tolerate during the occasions when neither side are in a position to undermine the other, but once they are... They take the advantage to do so.

02/06/2025, 18:25 - +44 7516 029853: They are very much pro-Russian, though it became so due to systemic oppression lasting decades. Top elite russian battalions are coming from Muslim regions in russia. They are poster children of the war machine in a sense.

There are still those who fought for independence in the 90s, but mostly, they cross the border and join the Dudayev Battalion. The oppression of nonloyal Chechens and Dagestani is predominantly conducted by Chechens and Dagestani themselves.

02/06/2025, 18:28 - +44 7516 029853: It's such a disgrace.
Instead of becoming more secular, they did exactly the opposite

03/06/2025, 10:05 - onur: Ive never seen that “relationship anarchy” per se
03/06/2025, 10:06 - onur: But I have seen a lot of polyamorous or ENM or people straight up cheating
03/06/2025, 10:12 - Parag-meetup: You are too old for it now !
03/06/2025, 10:13 - onur: 😮‍💨
03/06/2025, 10:13 - Parag-meetup: It’s just thier business model 
It has improved a lot from 6 months ago . 
It used to be horrendous . 
But still very annoying I agree
03/06/2025, 10:13 - onur: They are trying to get more clicks on different pages accidentaly right?
03/06/2025, 10:14 - Parag-meetup: Under 30 , there is really quite stupid to go into any long term relationship
03/06/2025, 10:17 - Parag-meetup: Ya , that counts as more viewership on their books and that brings in more funding
03/06/2025, 10:31 - +44 7931 159803: People call it situationships lmao
03/06/2025, 10:34 - +44 7931 159803: Me talking to a king with a harem of over 100 women
03/06/2025, 10:55 - onur: Yeah but that word has a bad connotation
03/06/2025, 10:56 - onur: Like people use it to describe effervescent relationships
03/06/2025, 10:57 - +353 89 605 0161: Risk free sex (health wise) from condom use
+
Decline in trad sexual values

Stagflation/Cost of living crisis

Polyamory
03/06/2025, 10:57 - +44 7889 480662: That's a very interesting correlation you have there lol
03/06/2025, 10:57 - +353 89 605 0161: Is there data on income/wealth and polyamory?

My instinct tells me it's skewed to lower income
03/06/2025, 10:58 - onur: Maybe in 3rd world countries yeah
03/06/2025, 10:58 - onur: Im not sure here
03/06/2025, 10:58 - +44 7889 480662: I don't agree with that seeing as to have multiple partners you would need a higher income
03/06/2025, 10:58 - +353 89 605 0161: Bunch of young unrelated people sharing a house.
03/06/2025, 10:58 - +353 89 605 0161: Why?
03/06/2025, 10:58 - +353 89 605 0161: Theyre gonna be at each other 🤷‍♂
03/06/2025, 10:59 - +44 7931 159803: What makes it effervescent?
03/06/2025, 10:59 - +44 7889 480662: Well think about it you would need to provide parts or if you're dating someone that doesn't believe in paying that means you're going to need to financially assist with that person plus polyamory is nothing to do with only sex it's also to do of actually loving multiple people
03/06/2025, 10:59 - +44 7889 480662: Sounds more like you love someone because of their gas exchanges 😂
03/06/2025, 10:59 - +44 7931 159803: True. Casual dating is another name, or short term dating
03/06/2025, 11:00 - +353 89 605 0161: That's just dating, not being in a relationship.

Polyamory would be way cheaper.
Split household costs multiple ways instead of just two
03/06/2025, 11:00 - +44 7889 480662: But that's not what polyamory is polyamory is long-term multiple partner relationships
03/06/2025, 11:00 - onur: I have a really hot asian housemate but she isnt really at me
03/06/2025, 11:00 - onur: We have this more independent setup
03/06/2025, 11:00 - +44 7931 159803: Relationship anarchy isn’t necessarily polyamory
03/06/2025, 11:00 - +44 7889 480662: Then you're not explaining polyamory you're explaining a thruple
03/06/2025, 11:00 - +44 7931 159803: Didn’t the article specify it’s not the same?
03/06/2025, 11:00 - +353 89 605 0161: Isn't a thruple a subset of polyamory?
03/06/2025, 11:00 - +44 7889 480662: Well not exactly
03/06/2025, 11:01 - +44 7889 480662: It's an example of polyamorousness which is different to polygamy
03/06/2025, 11:01 - +353 89 605 0161: I didn't read the article tbf 😅

Onurs complaint put me off
03/06/2025, 11:01 - +44 7931 159803: Oh the article sucks too
03/06/2025, 11:01 - +44 7889 480662: You should never let anyone sway your opinion of reading articles
03/06/2025, 11:01 - onur: A ménage à trois
03/06/2025, 11:01 - onur: Hahahah
03/06/2025, 11:01 - onur: Have you guys seen gaspar noe - love?
03/06/2025, 11:01 - onur: Or
03/06/2025, 11:01 - onur: Irreversible?
03/06/2025, 11:02 - +44 7889 480662: I've heard of it never watched it
03/06/2025, 11:02 - onur: Both includes a “thruple”
03/06/2025, 11:02 - +353 89 605 0161: Well, here I mean stable romantic relationships between >2 people
03/06/2025, 11:02 - onur: Really good movie but a bit hard to watch at times
03/06/2025, 11:03 - +353 89 605 0161: My sister is in one and she's broke.
Thats my anecdotal evidence I'll base my entire view on 🫡
03/06/2025, 11:03 - +44 7889 480662: How do you figure that explains a romantic relationship with two more people what you're explaining ia hookup culture
03/06/2025, 11:03 - +44 7931 159803: “Meanwhile, a rising trend among young people is a phenomenon called “relationship anarchy”: an anti-hierarchical approach which sees equal weight given to all kinds of relationships, whether they are platonic, romantic, sexual or familial. Unlike polyamory or open relationships, relationship anarchy doesn’t prioritise romantic bonds over friendships or other connections.”
03/06/2025, 11:03 - +44 7889 480662: That's just one example you can't use that as anecdotal evidence you would need to have multiple occasions of it existing
03/06/2025, 11:03 - +44 7889 480662: Actually no a rising trend of young people is situationships
03/06/2025, 11:03 - onur: Well tbh womens financials dont really matter
03/06/2025, 11:03 - +353 89 605 0161: I certainly _can_ use it as anecdotal evidence. It's actually the only thing I can use it for.
03/06/2025, 11:03 - +44 7931 159803: That’s what I was saying
03/06/2025, 11:04 - +44 7889 480662: Not really because I know very rich people that are in polyamorous relationships
03/06/2025, 11:04 - +44 7889 480662: Relationship anarchy and situationships are not the same thing
03/06/2025, 11:04 - +44 7931 159803: Are they all rich?
03/06/2025, 11:04 - onur: I think @⁨~Alex S⁩ was thinking more like 3rd world country lens haha
03/06/2025, 11:04 - +44 7889 480662: I think it's more of a trend to the rich because they have the money in order to basically do whatever they like
03/06/2025, 11:04 - +44 7931 159803: Yeah I misread, I was saying that sittationships are common though
03/06/2025, 11:04 - +353 89 605 0161: You can use that for _your_ anecdotal evidence then
03/06/2025, 11:05 - onur: Btw why we have 4 alexs
03/06/2025, 11:05 - onur: In the group
03/06/2025, 11:05 - +44 7889 480662: They are actually less likely to be in relationship
03/06/2025, 11:05 - onur: Wdym
03/06/2025, 11:05 - +44 7889 480662: There's no need to change the font we all know what you
03/06/2025, 11:05 - +44 7931 159803: Yeah what I mean is it that they date multiple poor people in exploitative ways
03/06/2025, 11:05 - +44 7889 480662: If people are in third world countries where the chance of bringing more children into such a poverty stricken area they will most likely be less inclined to have children because you're basically bringing children into the world to die
03/06/2025, 11:06 - +353 89 605 0161: The font is just for emphasis...
03/06/2025, 11:06 - +44 7889 480662: Not really once again it goes for that idea of rich don't want to associate with the poor
03/06/2025, 11:06 - +44 7889 480662: Once again it's unnecessary emphasis
03/06/2025, 11:06 - +44 7931 159803: Depends on who you are
03/06/2025, 11:06 - +44 7931 159803: But sure I read ya
03/06/2025, 11:06 - +353 89 605 0161: Not when I type it 🤷‍♂
03/06/2025, 11:06 - onur: They dont have such a reasoning most of the time, birth rates are the highest in the poorest countries
03/06/2025, 11:07 - +44 7889 480662: Adding emphasis in a adult philosophical situation makes you look pretentious
03/06/2025, 11:07 - onur: Who cares
03/06/2025, 11:07 - +353 89 605 0161: God forbid
03/06/2025, 11:07 - onur: He just wanted to convey a meaning better
03/06/2025, 11:07 - +44 7931 159803: Real
03/06/2025, 11:07 - +44 7931 159803: I like emphasis
03/06/2025, 11:08 - +44 7931 159803: Gives personality to the conversation
03/06/2025, 11:08 - +353 89 605 0161: It's about making something more obviously a joke.

I thought self identifying my view point as based on anecdotal evidence was obviously a joke, but when you didn't get it I was trying to make it more obvious.
03/06/2025, 11:08 - onur: I liked it too yea
03/06/2025, 11:08 - +44 7599 430972: Wow my doppelgänger is getting roasted for using a whatsapp function
03/06/2025, 11:08 - +44 7599 430972: How does it feel to live in 2025 now, huh!?
03/06/2025, 11:08 - +44 7889 480662: You give personality to a conversation in many different ways applying emphasis in a smart people group is basically like jangling keys in front of a simple minded child
03/06/2025, 11:08 - onur: You have 4 doppelgangers now
03/06/2025, 11:09 - +353 89 605 0161: It's certainly grabbed your attention
03/06/2025, 11:09 - onur: Including you
03/06/2025, 11:09 - +44 7599 430972: But yeah just like with cohabitation I find it more of an economic effect on relationships
03/06/2025, 11:09 - +44 7931 159803: Smart people group? Have you been reading these conversations? 😛
03/06/2025, 11:09 - +44 7889 480662: Don't flatter yourself Alex
03/06/2025, 11:09 - +44 7599 430972: Try to raise a child when there are just two of you with fake jobs
03/06/2025, 11:09 - +353 89 605 0161: Don't tell me what to do
03/06/2025, 11:09 - +44 7931 159803: We’re all dumbasses here sorry to say
03/06/2025, 11:09 - +44 7889 480662: Just because I made an observation it does not mean you have my attention
03/06/2025, 11:10 - +353 89 605 0161: It must, surely.
03/06/2025, 11:10 - +44 7889 480662: No it doesn't and don't call me surely
03/06/2025, 11:10 - +353 89 605 0161: To observe something, are you not giving it your attention?
03/06/2025, 11:10 - onur: 😅🤣
03/06/2025, 11:10 - onur: I dont understand if its banter or aggression <This message was edited>
03/06/2025, 11:10 - +44 7599 430972: I haven’t seen anyone being so pressed about an italic
03/06/2025, 11:11 - +44 7889 480662: No it's like being in a room full of people and looking to the side and noticing a plant being attacked by the cat you're not giving your full attention to it
03/06/2025, 11:11 - onur: Cats are cute
03/06/2025, 11:11 - +44 7599 430972: cringe
03/06/2025, 11:12 - +44 7889 480662: Couldn't care less what you think 😂
03/06/2025, 11:12 - +353 89 605 0161: That's just dividing your attention
03/06/2025, 11:12 - +44 7599 430972: double cringe
03/06/2025, 11:12 - +44 7889 480662: Not at all noticing you're using italics on WhatsApp wasn't even one tenth of my attention to be fair
03/06/2025, 11:12 - onur: You have my undivided attention
03/06/2025, 11:13 - +44 7889 480662: Then you need to get a hobby 😂
03/06/2025, 11:13 - +353 89 605 0161: Wow, I feel so small now
03/06/2025, 11:13 - onur: What kind of hobbies do you recommend?
03/06/2025, 11:13 - +44 7599 430972: arguing online
03/06/2025, 11:13 - +44 7599 430972: women find it extremely attractive
03/06/2025, 11:13 - +44 7889 480662: Debating not arguing lol
03/06/2025, 11:14 - onur: 😅 where do you get all these women
03/06/2025, 11:14 - +44 7599 430972: In my polycule
03/06/2025, 11:14 - +353 89 605 0161: Anyways.

Cohabiting, I think is a product of what I was saying before.
Perhaps more accurate term than polyamory.
03/06/2025, 11:14 - onur: All i see is grown men arguing over italic font
03/06/2025, 11:14 - +44 7889 480662: Really I what you were uglymaskule
03/06/2025, 11:14 - +44 7889 480662: 😂
03/06/2025, 11:15 - +44 7889 480662: And that is a very valid opinion and you are allowed it it doesn't mean it's the correct way of looking at things
03/06/2025, 11:15 - +44 7599 430972: To be pernickety italic is a font _style_, but not a font
03/06/2025, 11:15 - onur: True dat
03/06/2025, 11:15 - +353 89 605 0161: Well that's why I submitted it to the group chat 👍
03/06/2025, 11:15 - +44 7599 430972: triple cringe
03/06/2025, 11:15 - +44 7889 480662: I can tell you Microsoft word with disagree
03/06/2025, 11:16 - +353 89 605 0161: I keep my sacred opinions to myself. Unchallenged 🙏
03/06/2025, 11:16 - +44 7889 480662: But I clearly challenged your opinion 😂
03/06/2025, 11:16 - +353 89 605 0161: The one I shared ☝️
Like I said above
03/06/2025, 11:16 - onur: This is more like a category name for all kinds of housemates including cults and these new societies
03/06/2025, 11:17 - +44 7889 480662: How do you separate new societies from cults?
03/06/2025, 11:17 - +353 89 605 0161: Hmm, we need a new term then!
03/06/2025, 11:17 - onur: I dont, they are cults :D
03/06/2025, 11:17 - onur: But just in case if someone is sepersting
03/06/2025, 11:17 - onur: I wrote them separately
03/06/2025, 11:17 - +44 7889 480662: Not at all what about fringe societies they're not cults
03/06/2025, 11:17 - +44 7599 430972: Also I think now when people know how attractive can people be they won’t settle for a mid. They can’t pull higher so they just keep mid partners on a slow burner <This message was edited>
03/06/2025, 11:17 - onur: Can you give an example?
03/06/2025, 11:18 - onur: Is low burner a slow burner?
03/06/2025, 11:18 - +44 7599 430972: yes
03/06/2025, 11:18 - +44 7889 480662: Tribes that literally prefer to stay out of our basic idea of civilization like the northlanderia people
03/06/2025, 11:19 - +44 7889 480662: They are a society of tribal people that specifically say that if you go anywhere near their people you will get several spears in you because they literally want to stay away from any modern civilization literally a Asian man try to convert them to Christianity and his body was ended with spears penetrating his form and being dragged into the encampment
03/06/2025, 11:19 - Parag-meetup: It’s mainly female financial independence which helps them behave more equally and make better decisions instead of being a second wheel in a baby making machine
03/06/2025, 11:20 - +44 7889 480662: I think polyamory would be more of a male trait because so many men believed that they need multiple women to satisfy their carnal desires if you will
03/06/2025, 11:20 - +44 7599 430972: I know a lot of men who would like to be a second wheel breeding machine
03/06/2025, 11:20 - Parag-meetup: ??
03/06/2025, 11:21 - +44 7889 480662: Maybe if they're cucks 😂
03/06/2025, 11:21 - +353 89 605 0161: But is the type of man who thinks that way also the type you tend to find in polyamorous relationships? <This message was edited>
03/06/2025, 11:21 - Parag-meetup: That I agree with 
And there’s no logic in doing long term dating when you are under 30
03/06/2025, 11:21 - Parag-meetup: Long term / short term
03/06/2025, 11:21 - +44 7889 480662: But people are still getting married in their twenties
03/06/2025, 11:22 - +44 7931 159803: Idk if that’s true, it’s practice for when it finally succeed, no.
03/06/2025, 11:22 - +44 7931 159803: No?*
03/06/2025, 11:22 - +44 7889 480662: Actually yes because they believe by giving the multiple partners or specifically multiple dominant males as they call themselves in the BDSM lifestyle the care compassion love they need to multiple women they will get the desires they are trying to crave and deal with
03/06/2025, 11:23 - Parag-meetup: Biologically it would be the other way around 
Men come only once whole women can have multiple orgasms 
A
03/06/2025, 11:24 - +44 7889 480662: You're basically talking about how a female associate with multiple men just so she could find the optimal breeding partner in order to bring the best children into the world but that goes for the idea of survival of the fittest and not all humans believe in that way
03/06/2025, 11:24 - +44 7931 159803: I also don’t know if I think that’s true
03/06/2025, 11:24 - +44 7931 159803: Men can go again and women too
03/06/2025, 11:24 - Parag-meetup: Ya practice with short term 
Model them on long terms
03/06/2025, 11:25 - +44 7889 480662: You got a date a lot of Ferraris before you find your clunker 😂
03/06/2025, 11:25 - +44 7931 159803: But the goal is to be long term regardless, right? To attempt to be at least
03/06/2025, 11:25 - Parag-meetup: No 
I’m talking about orgasms !

Makes have one 
Women multiple and cascading 

It’s biological
03/06/2025, 11:25 - onur: rich and old men are getting more than one women in 3rd world countries
03/06/2025, 11:25 - onur: what?
03/06/2025, 11:25 - +353 89 605 0161: Can we clarify what we mean by polyamory?

Is it just anything which isn't strict monogamy?
03/06/2025, 11:25 - onur: yeah I guess
03/06/2025, 11:25 - +44 7931 159803: Is it? I gotta say maybe I’m biologically different then
03/06/2025, 11:25 - +44 7889 480662: Yes but what is the end goal of orgasms it's to provide the breeding code for the next generation
03/06/2025, 11:26 - +44 7889 480662: No that's not true remember polygamy is only one type of that you also have polyamorousness and of course asexualness
03/06/2025, 11:26 - onur: what?
03/06/2025, 11:26 - onur: :D
03/06/2025, 11:26 - +44 7889 480662: Clearly the person has had unsatisfying it in encounters
03/06/2025, 11:27 - +44 7931 159803: Short refractory period
03/06/2025, 11:27 - Parag-meetup: The sympathetic system which causes ejection , goes into a pause for a bit 
May be males can do it again in a couple of minutes or half an hour , but that’s recruiting the para sympathetic system again , washing away the cortisol from sympathetic drive 

For women , it’s just additive , every orgasms is more parasympathetic activity
03/06/2025, 11:27 - +44 7599 430972: Yeah it’s unclear what meant by orgasm since men can have another go after ejaculating
03/06/2025, 11:27 - +44 7599 430972: Oh so it’s meant literally consequential
03/06/2025, 11:27 - +44 7889 480662: It's basically like popping a cork on a champagne bottle compared to letting a host pipe drip basically
03/06/2025, 11:27 - +353 89 605 0161: Can't asexual fall under either?
I don't think it's relevant for polyamory vs monogamy(monoamory?) 

You can be asexually romantic with one or multiple people.
03/06/2025, 11:28 - +44 7599 430972: Without a half a minute breather
03/06/2025, 11:28 - onur: I didn't understand that's why asked but now I didn't understand even more but everybody seems to be understanding so maybe its me
03/06/2025, 11:28 - +44 7889 480662: Well then how do you explain polyamorous they're not the same as polygamous
03/06/2025, 11:28 - Parag-meetup: No more , that’s the whole reason why things have changed 
Almost no one has sex now wanting to pro create .. other than planned pregnancies <This message was edited>
03/06/2025, 11:28 - +44 7889 480662: Procreate is one word not two
03/06/2025, 11:29 - onur: I think he meant at once
03/06/2025, 11:29 - +353 89 605 0161: Polyamory is the term I'm asking to be defined.

I don't think I said that polyamory was the same as polygamy.
03/06/2025, 11:30 - +44 7889 480662: Then it can't only be polygamy and monogamy it's polygamy monogamy and polyamory
03/06/2025, 11:30 - +353 89 605 0161: Polygamy, I think, is being married to multiple people.

Polyamorous doesn't require marriage
03/06/2025, 11:30 - +44 7931 159803: I did not, I just meant within the same session
03/06/2025, 11:30 - onur: Its basically a person who is able to feel romantic feelings more than only one person
03/06/2025, 11:30 - Parag-meetup: There are two different opposing systems in place for erection and ejaculation 
Depending on your arousal and age it might take from 30 seconds to 45 mins to never for makes 

For females it’s one additive system
03/06/2025, 11:30 - +44 7931 159803: I recognise now Parag meant at the same time
03/06/2025, 11:30 - +44 7889 480662: What polyamorous people feel love for multiple people as well so not true
03/06/2025, 11:30 - onur: Got it
03/06/2025, 11:31 - onur: What?
03/06/2025, 11:31 - +44 7931 159803: I feel love for my friends so I don’t see how polyamorous people can’t also love multipolar people
03/06/2025, 11:31 - +44 7931 159803: Multiple*
03/06/2025, 11:32 - +353 89 605 0161: So polygamy would be a subset of polyamory I would think.
03/06/2025, 11:32 - +44 7599 430972: Also I am pretty sure love is not required to be in a relationship
03/06/2025, 11:32 - onur: It is literally in the name -> poly = more than one
Amour = love
03/06/2025, 11:32 - +44 7889 480662: No because some people are polygamist and some people are polyamist
03/06/2025, 11:32 - onur: That is why I used romantic feelings instead of love
03/06/2025, 11:32 - +44 7931 159803: Real but sad
03/06/2025, 11:32 - Parag-meetup: Yes you do 
I’ve been in a few 
And failed everytime spectacularly 
It’s a high tension , fragile system , and human emotions like jealousy and needs break it down
03/06/2025, 11:33 - +44 7889 480662: Romantic feelings and love are connected
03/06/2025, 11:33 - +353 89 605 0161: People can be more than one thing... You know what a subset is? <This message was edited>
03/06/2025, 11:33 - +44 7599 430972: Also with romantic feelings. Sometimes you don’t feel anything towards a person but you feel shitty/lonely alone
03/06/2025, 11:33 - +44 7931 159803: Sounds like a problem with the people rather than the system
03/06/2025, 11:33 - +44 7889 480662: No shit Sherlock
03/06/2025, 11:33 - onur: Yeah but when “love” mentioned it has all of this historical and literal baggage
03/06/2025, 11:33 - onur: I wouldnt want to drag them in as well
03/06/2025, 11:33 - +44 7889 480662: Then that's not romantic feelings that's being lonely
03/06/2025, 11:33 - +44 7931 159803: Like I gotta say that sounds like most relationships monogamous or otherwise
03/06/2025, 11:34 - +44 7889 480662: If your going to ask questions can you slow down gosh
03/06/2025, 11:34 - onur: Hmm
03/06/2025, 11:35 - +44 7889 480662: But what I'm trying to say polygamous and polyamorous people can end up loving multiple people very deeply even knowing it's a disgusting way to live but still
03/06/2025, 11:35 - onur: Why would you describe this as sad?
03/06/2025, 11:35 - Parag-meetup: Absolutely 

But also with the system 

Having one who’s first priority is you , means that he or she is only with you , or you are their primary . 

That would really work long term if it is reciprocated , which means they will be your first priority 

Which means it really only works in a 2 unit relationship 

Or monogamy
03/06/2025, 11:35 - +44 7889 480662: Which is how I am
03/06/2025, 11:36 - +353 89 605 0161: Well if its obvious why did you reply that there are polygomous people and polyamorous people and therefore polygamy cannot be a subset of polyamory?
03/06/2025, 11:36 - +44 7599 430972: It’s just people only analyse relationships from very “romantic comedy mutual love” standpoint. But people are entering relationships for myriad reasons and sometimes monogamy is just superficial for the purpose
03/06/2025, 11:37 - +44 7889 480662: Because people who are specifically and strictly polyamorous would not call himself polygamous so it's not a subset
03/06/2025, 11:37 - +44 7931 159803: Everyone should be in love 100% of the time, no decision making allowed
03/06/2025, 11:37 - +44 7889 480662: What I want to know is anyone here actually polygamous or polyamorou
03/06/2025, 11:37 - +44 7889 480662: Polyamorous?
03/06/2025, 11:38 - +44 7889 480662: That's ridiculous
03/06/2025, 11:38 - +44 7931 159803: Is it? I think it’s actually the most serious argument I’ve made so far
03/06/2025, 11:38 - Parag-meetup: I’m sure there are 
I know a few
03/06/2025, 11:38 - Parag-meetup: Usually young tho
03/06/2025, 11:39 - +44 7889 480662: No I meant in this group are any of you
03/06/2025, 11:39 - +44 7599 430972: It’s hard to quantify since this group contains multiple copies of the same person
03/06/2025, 11:39 - +353 89 605 0161: But polyamory is just being in romantic relationship with multiple people.
Being married is, ostensibly, a romantic relationship.
Being polygamist is being married to multiple people.

Where does that fall down? Why can't we consider polygamy as a subset of polyamory?
03/06/2025, 11:39 - +44 7931 159803: Real
03/06/2025, 11:40 - +353 89 605 0161: We're a polycule
03/06/2025, 11:40 - +44 7889 480662: Because specifically people that side with one over the other would not want to be called that it goes down to personal opinion of why it can't be a subset because some people believe they are one and some people believe they are the other
03/06/2025, 11:42 - +353 89 605 0161: I'm not sure our categorisation should be too concerned with individuals personal preference tbh

We're not really talking about the individuals anyway, but their romantic networks/relations to each other.
03/06/2025, 11:43 - +44 7889 480662: But all of this is to do with people's personal preference you personally choose if you are going to be monogamistic polyamorous or polygamistic or a sexual
03/06/2025, 11:43 - +353 89 605 0161: I.e. If I've signed a marriage contract with someone. We're married while contract is in force, regardless of whether I feel like I'm married.
03/06/2025, 11:44 - +44 7889 480662: To remove personal preference from the conversation would be to remove the conversation in total
03/06/2025, 11:45 - +353 89 605 0161: So if I claim I'm monogamous, but I regularly have sex with people outside my marriage. I'm still monogamous if it's my personal prefence to be referred to as such?
03/06/2025, 11:45 - +44 7889 480662: Then you're clearly not monogamistic
03/06/2025, 11:45 - +44 7599 430972: Careful with this line of thinking, you’re that close 🤏 to calling french people monogamous
03/06/2025, 11:45 - +44 7889 480662: All your monogamistic and you like to cheat and that's just disgusting
03/06/2025, 11:45 - +353 89 605 0161: So my personal preference doesn't matter?
03/06/2025, 11:46 - Parag-meetup: Its just cheating 
But you are in a monogamous relationship
03/06/2025, 11:46 - +44 7889 480662: You chose to be in a monogamistic marriage at the beginning but the cheat on that makes you no longer monogamistic
03/06/2025, 11:47 - +353 89 605 0161: 🤔
I'm not sure about that one.
Surely it's no longer monogamous if one of them is cheating?
03/06/2025, 11:47 - +353 89 605 0161: So it's their behaviour not their self identity which defines it?
03/06/2025, 11:47 - +44 7889 480662: But that's the thing it's still a monogamistic binding because you chose to marry that one person
03/06/2025, 11:48 - +44 7889 480662: Just because you have random encounters that associates with cheating does not make you any less monogamistic there are many different reasons to cheat on a partner it doesn't mean you're changing your preference
03/06/2025, 11:48 - +353 89 605 0161: The marriage is monogamous but the individual isn't?
03/06/2025, 11:49 - +44 7889 480662: I responded to that one
03/06/2025, 11:49 - +44 7889 480662: To become polygamous or polyamorous love needs to be included hooking up with some random tramp and cheating on your partner does not make you either of the two other types of relationship
03/06/2025, 11:52 - +353 89 605 0161: Okay, so let's replace sex with love in what I was saying before.

If someone is married to one person and falls in love with someone else, and they're in love with their marriage partner and this other individual.

They're polyamorous now?
03/06/2025, 11:52 - +44 7889 480662: How do you know you're in love with someone else if it's not part of a personal preference for that person
03/06/2025, 11:53 - +44 7889 480662: There are many things that could be going on there that may not be love believe me
03/06/2025, 11:54 - +353 89 605 0161: Well that could be true for any romantic relationship.
03/06/2025, 11:54 - +44 7889 480662: And I didn't denounce that did I
03/06/2025, 11:56 - +353 89 605 0161: No, but since it can be true for the original marriage as much as it can be true for the new love I don't think it changes whether this person is monogamous or polyamorous.

They think they're in love with both.
03/06/2025, 11:56 - +44 7889 480662: But there are far too many variables in this situation for it to specifically just be polyamorous or polygamous
03/06/2025, 11:56 - Parag-meetup: Your proclamation is of a monogamous relationship 

That’s what your partner knows 

That’s why ethically non monogamous comes into play
03/06/2025, 11:57 - onur: First they start with an alex, now we got 4, where does it stop? <This message was edited>
03/06/2025, 11:57 - +44 7889 480662: When chaos reigns supreme 😂
03/06/2025, 11:58 - +353 89 605 0161: My whole point is that it doesn't have to be _just_ one or the other for polygamy or polyamory.

And I don't think the personal preference for a label is very important in how we choose to categorise them for the sake of conversation. <This message was edited>
03/06/2025, 11:59 - +44 7889 480662: Well then you don't understand polygamy and polyamory as much as you think you do because everything of this has to do a personal preference
03/06/2025, 11:59 - +353 89 605 0161: I think what I was saying before trailed away from what I was trying to say.
03/06/2025, 11:59 - +353 89 605 0161: You don't know how much I think I understand it 😅
03/06/2025, 11:59 - +44 7889 480662: Fascinating tangent Alex get back to the point at hand
03/06/2025, 11:59 - +353 89 605 0161: This is why I was asking
03/06/2025, 12:00 - +353 89 605 0161: What is the difference between them?
03/06/2025, 12:00 - +44 7889 480662: But choosing how your love style will be will always be a personal preference
03/06/2025, 12:01 - +353 89 605 0161: Your presupposing that they are different things.

Im trying to figure out if they are, or if there isn't a significant or total overlap between them.
03/06/2025, 12:01 - +44 7889 480662: <Media omitted>
03/06/2025, 12:01 - +44 7889 480662: Here's your differences between polygamy and polyamory
03/06/2025, 12:03 - onur: They all sound like whoring around to me
03/06/2025, 12:03 - +44 7889 480662: Then you have a very close-minded outlook on how love works
03/06/2025, 12:03 - +353 89 605 0161: Sounds like this then ☝️
03/06/2025, 12:03 - +44 7599 430972: You sound jealous
03/06/2025, 12:04 - onur: Yeah i am not getting even one
03/06/2025, 12:04 - onur: While people get multiple
03/06/2025, 12:04 - onur: Nice to meet you
03/06/2025, 12:04 - +44 7599 430972: Looser
03/06/2025, 12:04 - onur: I like loosening up
03/06/2025, 12:05 - +353 89 605 0161: This sounds like what I said before then.

If we consider marriage as a romantically motivated contract. I'm aware it isn't always like that, but there'll always be some things which don't fit.
03/06/2025, 12:05 - +44 7599 430972: I hope you’re not talking about any orifices of yours
03/06/2025, 12:06 - onur: 🤣🤣

BBC concerned about the BBC....
06/06/2025, 11:49 - Parag-meetup: But even then he has amassed a wealth of the back of corruption more than the last 17 presidents together
06/06/2025, 11:50 - Will-hazzer777: This is not an answer or a real statement anybody who uses such a phrase should be instantly ignored.
06/06/2025, 11:51 - Parag-meetup: It is a fallacy that you are using to deflect answering a question 

Anyone who uses this fallacy shouldn’t be considered seriously 

Obviously pointing out how you are wrong makes you insecure , and you want people to ignore them !

06/06/2025, 12:23 - Parag-meetup: There you go 
When the facts line up against you , who cares 
When they are for you , you harp on them
06/06/2025, 12:25 - Will-hazzer777: I mean, whether they're fact or not... A value judgement has to be made about them... Calling a rock a rock is a fact... Do I have strong opinions about it? No.. there's loads of facts I don't have strong opinions on.
06/06/2025, 12:33 - Parag-meetup: Value judgement
06/06/2025, 12:33 - Parag-meetup: It wasn’t appropriate ! 
I thought you were making value judgements
06/06/2025, 12:34 - Parag-meetup: Again when it suits your narrative it’s all ok
06/06/2025, 12:35 - Will-hazzer777: Yeah well there's a difference between the owner of a business doing deals and one of his employees making executive decisions.
06/06/2025, 13:46 - Parag-meetup: Who’s who in this case ?
06/06/2025, 13:59 - Will-hazzer777: Trump is running America, musk is one of America's long term employees.
06/06/2025, 14:00 - Parag-meetup: Is that a fact
06/06/2025, 14:01 - Will-hazzer777: Yep
06/06/2025, 14:01 - Parag-meetup: Owner of the buisness is going deals which help himself and harms the buisness
06/06/2025, 14:01 - Parag-meetup: Also he’s not the owner , he’s the servant serving his duty for 4 years
06/06/2025, 14:02 - Will-hazzer777: That's up to the shareholders to deal with if they care about it... An employee however doesn't get to make the same shots as the CEO. <This message was edited>
06/06/2025, 14:03 - Will-hazzer777: Well he's the CEO then if that's more apt...
06/06/2025, 14:03 - Parag-meetup: ??
Ofcourse they do , they are less culpable and accountable
06/06/2025, 14:03 - Parag-meetup: Buck stops at the ceo

12/06/2025, 14:04 - Will-hazzer777: It's all relative... Poor locals who have live here all their lives being pushed out by recently arrived third worlders.
12/06/2025, 14:48 - +44 7958 612614: How does that work?  How does one get pushed out by Third Worlders?
12/06/2025, 14:49 - Will-hazzer777: Clearly, resources are allocated by those who are most in need. The more children you have the more in need you are.
12/06/2025, 14:49 - +44 7958 612614: oh, so you get asked to become homeless because someone else needs your flat more?

London has the largest proportion of migrants among UK regions, with over 40% of its residents born abroad
https://migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk/resources/briefings/migrants-in-the-uk-an-overview/
12/06/2025, 15:39 - Will-hazzer777: Thank you... It proves my point.... Their take up of social housing is disproportionate.
12/06/2025, 15:40 - +353 89 605 0161: Be interesting to see the turnover
12/06/2025, 15:41 - +353 89 605 0161: As @⁨Will-hazzer777⁩ says, people who have been their all their life being turfed out.

If the immigrants are only socially housed temporarily before moving into the private sector, maybe that's a better use of gov funds?
12/06/2025, 15:41 - Will-hazzer777: There's 8 percentage points difference between 40% and 48%... We've got enough poor of our own to needing to have to take on the burden of the rest of the world's...

Why are we importing dependant people?
12/06/2025, 15:42 - +353 89 605 0161: Depends what we think the point of social housing is I guess
12/06/2025, 15:42 - Will-hazzer777: Call it foreign aid then!
12/06/2025, 15:43 - Will-hazzer777: I hope the foreigners amongst this group, who stand on their own two feet at least, know that they are similarly paying for this out of their wages.
12/06/2025, 15:44 - Will-hazzer777: So you better dig deep, especially in London.
12/06/2025, 15:45 - Will-hazzer777: Cough up the cash and like it!
12/06/2025, 15:45 - +44 7958 612614: disproportionate to their number?  Do they get 2 flats each?
12/06/2025, 15:45 - Will-hazzer777: Disproportionate to their percentage share of population.
12/06/2025, 15:45 - +44 7958 612614: “our own?”  Do you own some poor people?
12/06/2025, 15:45 - Will-hazzer777: Cough cough

12/06/2025, 15:46 - Will-hazzer777: I count my poorer fellow citizens and those who have naturalised as 'my poor'.
12/06/2025, 15:46 - Will-hazzer777: Yes and you're paying...
12/06/2025, 15:46 - +44 7516 029853: fiy, under the Skilled Worker Visa, foreigners pay all taxes in full but have no right to public funds. additionally, upon losing a job as a Skilled Worker, there is a limited window to find a new one without access to social benefits
12/06/2025, 15:46 - +44 7958 612614: Why do I care if a poor person X enjoys my money or poor person Y?
12/06/2025, 15:47 - Will-hazzer777: Taxes are only going to go up to pay for all of this and we know that there are lots of wealthy people in London who like to dress down...
12/06/2025, 15:47 - +44 7958 612614: it’s not like one of them is going to thank me in a foreign language
12/06/2025, 15:48 - Will-hazzer777: They don't pay enough in my opinion and yes and they'll pay more in future too... Because this needs paying for...
12/06/2025, 15:48 - +44 7958 612614: well, if your environment is characterised by diminishing your options and resources - you should leave, well - me too

12/06/2025, 15:49 - +44 7958 612614: happens all the time.  the only reason why we have immigrants is that we’ve screwed up their economical model and undermined their future wherever they were in the first place

12/06/2025, 15:50 - Will-hazzer777: It's not for you to question... It's your job just to cough it up and pay the man... And also cheerlead for your taxes in the meantime...

19/06/2025, 17:44 - +44 7516 029853: it most countries (needs to be checked if that is the case in the UK), prisoners are working while there. 
they contribute to the economy, though forcibly
19/06/2025, 17:45 - +44 7516 029853: it is definitely the case in the US, they are a sort of business enterprise (fully privatised) and even have quotas on the number of prisoners.
19/06/2025, 17:51 - +44 7516 029853: yeah, it is on the UK taxpayers

05/07/2025, 13:16 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: New England Journal of Medicine | NEJM | Microsoft AI *AI Doctors*

Microsoft Claims Its AI Diagnostic Tool Outperformed 21 Doctors, Accurate In 85.5% Cases

Microsoft has introduced a new artificial intelligence (AI) system that it says can diagnose some of the most difficult medical cases more accurately and at a lower cost than human doctors.

The system, called the Microsoft AI Diagnostic Orchestrator (MAI-DxO), was tested using case studies published by the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM). These cases are known for being particularly complex and usually involve teams of specialists. According to Microsoft, the AI got the correct diagnosis 85.5 per cent of the time, compared to just 20 per cent for a group of experienced doctors from the US and UK.

11/07/2025, 10:31 - +44 7516 029853: I took a bus in Berlin a few months ago, it was a brand-new two-story vehicle. The number of fundamental issues with its design I could spot while not being an engineer (just being curious about it) was horrifying. And all of it, with its famous German 'survive-or-die' bureaucracy. 

Then I went on a walk with friends at Tempelhof Park (the former Nazi, incredibly impressive, airport turned into a park). We were discussing airports in Berlin, I came back home, and read an article about the infamous Brandenburg Airport construction

11/07/2025, 10:41 - +44 7599 430972: That makes me remember the book Three Comrades. It’s set in post WW1 Germany and (SPOILER ALERT) in the entire book one hero really cherishes and loves his car which is his own custom built car and which won many races. When protagonist girlfriend falls ill he quietly sells the car and pays for her treatment 
And I thought 
“Surely a german would never do that”

"It does not have a door, it will be accumulating dust. You should fix it"

11/07/2025, 11:58 - +91 80720 44735: Let's not forget, a Billionaire, even a fake one like T, chooses his 'enablers'... Those 'speaking Truth to Power' will just be kicked to the curb like protestors at his infamous rallies
11/07/2025, 11:59 - Parag-meetup: I meant the people who voted him in ? 
Did you vote for him .. don’t lie !
11/07/2025, 12:01 - +91 80720 44735: Yeah,  you can 'blame' 77 million people, but where does that get you?
11/07/2025, 12:02 - +44 7599 430972: To 77 million enemies
11/07/2025, 12:02 - Parag-meetup: Not voting in grandpas
11/07/2025, 12:02 - +44 7599 430972: The bride vs Crazy 88
11/07/2025, 12:04 - +91 80720 44735: I don't even think it's 'ignorance' - just plain old racism and White Supremacy - he just *wants* to believe that since Whites invented English, there's no chance an African could speak it well, maybe even better than him... He not only bothered to figure out if that was true, but would not believe evidence contrary to what he wanted to keep thinking!!

11/07/2025, 12:08 - Parag-meetup: You gotta discount them
11/07/2025, 12:08 - Parag-meetup: And not let them take up leadership positions 
Except bingo
11/07/2025, 12:13 - +91 80720 44735: Well, you think Biden was similarly bad?
11/07/2025, 12:21 - Parag-meetup: Yes !

11/07/2025, 12:22 - +91 80720 44735: We have to be able to see Shades of Grey - Biden had his 'senior moments', sure, but that was performative politics, never had a policy misstep - in fact, achieved more than even Obama for all his charisma
11/07/2025, 12:23 - +91 80720 44735: Contrast with T's all around bat shit craziness
11/07/2025, 12:23 - +91 80720 44735: Which he is proud of, actually
11/07/2025, 12:24 - Parag-meetup: Ya agree 
Also complimenting the Liberian president on his English is not a policy misstep 

I am talking about this bit of the problem

11/07/2025, 12:25 - +91 80720 44735: In case Border Patrol searches my WhatsApp for 'Trump' 🤫

11/07/2025, 12:25 - Parag-meetup: You must be on his naughty list
11/07/2025, 12:26 - +91 80720 44735: Yet others want tax cuts more, but they are willing to stomach the craziness, or hope the fire can be put out with minimal damage
11/07/2025, 12:26 - +91 80720 44735: His own VP is on the list, what hope do I have?
11/07/2025, 12:31 - Parag-meetup: No , but seriously , are you worried ?
11/07/2025, 12:31 - Parag-meetup: I’m not keen on even visiting USA right now

@⁨Will-hazzer777⁩ @⁨~Martin⁩
11/07/2025, 12:33 - Parag-meetup: Does @⁨~Alex S⁩ support him ?
11/07/2025, 12:33 - +91 80720 44735: They would just say, 'Rounding up "criminals" is the right thing to do'
11/07/2025, 12:33 - +91 80720 44735: And they are 'criminals' because they are here illegally
11/07/2025, 12:35 - +91 80720 44735: But the fact that all procedures are 'optional' is the scariest part - unmarked vans, hooded officers who don't identify themselves, just 'kidnapping' you off the street, no info to family, no Habeus Corpus, no right to judicial access, summary deportation to any random country like El Salvador, and sent to 'indefinite prison sentences over there
11/07/2025, 12:35 - +91 80720 44735: Reads like it's out of 1984
11/07/2025, 12:36 - Parag-meetup: What are you doing 
Get out now
11/07/2025, 12:36 - +91 80720 44735: I can always 'get out' - Asian privilege 😉
11/07/2025, 12:37 - +91 80720 44735: I just need to keep my head down, avoid protesting, and wait for the next guy
11/07/2025, 12:37 - Parag-meetup: Not joking 
Really , isn’t it a problem for your career ?
11/07/2025, 12:37 - +91 80720 44735: Modi is not gonna let Indians go to El Salvador, plus I'm here legally
11/07/2025, 12:38 - +91 80720 44735: It is if I go back, I have to work for 1/10th of what I make here
11/07/2025, 12:38 - Parag-meetup: Hahahahaa
11/07/2025, 12:38 - Parag-meetup: Other counties ?
11/07/2025, 12:39 - +91 80720 44735: Yeah, I'm looking at options, but EU is shaky right now, not just the Ukraine war, but also Trump Tariff war cum recession
11/07/2025, 12:39 - +91 80720 44735: Risky to make a move
11/07/2025, 12:40 - +91 80720 44735: There's millions like me here, so safety in numbers, fish style? Lol
11/07/2025, 12:41 - +91 80720 44735: It's a 'night is darkest before the dawn' kinda thing, I just need to survive...
11/07/2025, 12:41 - +91 80720 44735: Until my next visa extension, atleast lol
11/07/2025, 12:42 - +91 80720 44735: Then I run outta runway either way, the choice is forced on me at that point
11/07/2025, 12:42 - +91 80720 44735: I'm trying hard to forget Spanish, in the meanwhile 😆
11/07/2025, 12:53 - +44 7958 612614: supporters of trump?  i don't support him, i just understand his ideology.
11/07/2025, 12:54 - Parag-meetup: You mean you empathise with his stupidity ?
11/07/2025, 12:55 - +91 80720 44735: Empathise, or atleast rationally explain, the seeming stupidity of his supporters
11/07/2025, 12:56 - +91 80720 44735: I do, have Trump voters in my family
11/07/2025, 12:59 - Parag-meetup: I can see Indians doing that
11/07/2025, 12:59 - +44 7958 612614: i'm smart enough to know he's not stupid
11/07/2025, 12:59 - Parag-meetup: He’s more Indian than American

11/07/2025, 13:02 - +44 7958 612614: no, he's smart - like a car it's good at doing what it's built for
11/07/2025, 13:02 - Parag-meetup: Entertaining people ?
11/07/2025, 13:02 - Parag-meetup: Also a certain cohort of people

11/07/2025, 13:04 - +91 80720 44735: As in, resists all intellectual thoughts 🤡
11/07/2025, 13:04 - +44 7958 612614: coming to that - you're quite immune to criticism. maybe there's something in it
11/07/2025, 13:05 - Parag-meetup: Immune to criticism isn’t the same as not having the insight
11/07/2025, 13:06 - +44 7958 612614: it's all in the results...  i was at a dinner last night with a theoretical physicist - everyone around the table was saying - you must be really intelligent and he was shyly going with it - never met a more boring and more stupid person. but for those of you who need numbers to come to realisations - maybe he's smart?
11/07/2025, 13:08 - Parag-meetup: As in never can a stupid person do something that can have a successful result even if it’s short term ?
11/07/2025, 13:09 - Parag-meetup: Although , in trumps case there hasn’t been even that
11/07/2025, 13:11 - Parag-meetup: Ukraine to receive US air defence systems, says Trump https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crl04200dp4o

11/07/2025, 15:06 - Will-hazzer777: "In principle, membership of these three groups is not hereditary. The
child of Inner Party parents is in theory not born into the Inner Party.
Admission to either branch of the Party is by examination, taken at the
age of sixteen. Nor is there any racial discrimination, or any marked
domination of one province by another. Jews, Negroes, South Americans of
pure Indian blood are to be found in the highest ranks of the Party, and
the administrators of any area are always drawn from the inhabitants of
that area. In no part of Oceania do the inhabitants have the feeling that
they are a colonial population ruled from a distant capital. Oceania has
no capital, and its titular head is a person whose whereabouts nobody
knows. Except that English is its chief LINGUA FRANCA and Newspeak its
official language, it is not centralized in any way. Its rulers are not
held together by blood-ties but by adherence to a common doctrine."

15/07/2025, 14:49 - Will-hazzer777: "we should be able to send our kids into school to celebrate British culture and history."

Mr Field said the school had now invited his daughter to come back in her dress and read a speech about why British culture was important to her.

But he told the BBC that she now "doesn't want to wear the dress" as "she doesn't feel comfortable".

Mr Field added: "None of this would have happened had [the school] just followed their own policy of inclusivity and let everyone share a little about their culture."

And he said: "I don't think anyone from school really read her speech. It was more a case of 'no, it's not happening'.""

18/07/2025, 00:30 - Will-hazzer777: "we should be able to send our kids into school to celebrate British culture and history."

Mr Field said the school had now invited his daughter to come back in her dress and read a speech about why British culture was important to her.

But he told the BBC that she now "doesn't want to wear the dress" as "she doesn't feel comfortable".

Mr Field added: "None of this would have happened had [the school] just followed their own policy of inclusivity and let everyone share a little about their culture."

And he said: "I don't think anyone from school really read her speech. It was more a case of 'no, it's not happening'.""

21/07/2025, 22:51 - Will-hazzer777: "Klaus Schwab, the face of the Davos conference in Switzerland for years, allegedly intervened in the WEF’s annual Global Competitiveness Report, which ranks countries on productivity and long-term prosperity.

In the 2017/2018 report, the UK’s ranking improved from seventh to fourth after a change in methodology.

But Mr Schwab, 87, wrote to staff that the UK “must not see any improvement”, as otherwise it would be “exploited by the Brexit camp”."

25/07/2025, 23:22 - onur: Hmmm
25/07/2025, 23:22 - onur: That could make sense
25/07/2025, 23:23 - +44 7516 029853: Unless the person is great and you are willing to take that responsibility, run
25/07/2025, 23:23 - onur: I think I lost my capability to love 9 years ago
25/07/2025, 23:23 - onur: It was one time deal xd
25/07/2025, 23:23 - +353 89 605 0161: I loved dating tbh
Thought it was great fun 🙌
25/07/2025, 23:23 - onur: So it is mostly transactional now
25/07/2025, 23:23 - onur: It is fun
25/07/2025, 23:24 - onur: I like women more than men
25/07/2025, 23:24 - +44 7516 029853: What are you offering to those women?
25/07/2025, 23:24 - onur: Men are better if you are trying to percieve them otherwise to be around women better
25/07/2025, 23:25 - onur: 🍆
25/07/2025, 23:25 - onur: :D
25/07/2025, 23:25 - +44 7599 430972: pickme edgelord
25/07/2025, 23:25 - +44 7516 029853: You mean cooking? That is a good skill to have!
25/07/2025, 23:26 - +353 89 605 0161: I find most women easier to connect with than most men, where it's like a weird power play.
25/07/2025, 23:26 - onur: Yes
25/07/2025, 23:26 - onur: Thats what i meant
25/07/2025, 23:26 - onur: How do u know my nickname
25/07/2025, 23:26 - +353 89 605 0161: It was a tragic accident where he had his love amputated 😞
25/07/2025, 23:26 - onur: Exactly :D
25/07/2025, 23:27 - +44 7599 430972: A lot of men yes, not all though. It is annoying especially in a corporate or artistic environment
25/07/2025, 23:27 - onur: I think otherwise !! If there is a cause I have also observed men sticking together like brotherhood kind of thing or the situation in army
25/07/2025, 23:28 - onur: Men act weird when there is a woman around
25/07/2025, 23:28 - +44 7599 430972: Nah I observed a lot of insecurity and concealed jealousy masqueraded by bro culture
25/07/2025, 23:28 - +44 7516 029853: Women are quite competitive. Especially with each other. Unless a woman is my real friend - I do not feel that warmth you all get from women, tbh.
25/07/2025, 23:28 - onur: That is also a case
25/07/2025, 23:28 - +44 7562 292419: So does anyone here actually like dates 😂😅
25/07/2025, 23:29 - +44 7599 430972: I do
25/07/2025, 23:29 - onur: I like them because thats like my only social event
25/07/2025, 23:29 - +44 7599 430972: I am not against healthy competition, it’s this male locker room culture that annoys me
25/07/2025, 23:30 - +44 7599 430972: Where instead of competing with me you’re trying to bring me down socially
25/07/2025, 23:30 - +44 7516 029853: Recently, my only social event became attending flat viewings. It is much more risky than dates
25/07/2025, 23:31 - +44 7562 292419: I'm kind of against competition. At least in the way that it makes us dehumanise one another
25/07/2025, 23:31 - +44 7562 292419: Ah 😅 I'm also looking for a new flat. It's much worse 😂
25/07/2025, 23:31 - +44 7516 029853: Does it happen between men as adults as well? Is it obvious?
25/07/2025, 23:32 - onur: For example I found myself preferring talking to men in the job interviews rather than a woman
25/07/2025, 23:32 - +44 7599 430972: Hmmm… I think I do have a lot of respect for people I’m competing against. I can even allow person to be a “diva” if I think they are truly talented. It’s just always someone boring who stirs the drama
25/07/2025, 23:32 - onur: I think it is more obvious compared to women
25/07/2025, 23:32 - onur: Women are more snarky
25/07/2025, 23:32 - +44 7599 430972: Yes, a lot
25/07/2025, 23:33 - +44 7516 029853: I spent Friday evening on this. It was so depressing, I came home to work(!) on an important project just to calm down.
25/07/2025, 23:33 - onur: Like they even fist fight and all
25/07/2025, 23:33 - onur: What else do you want to see?
25/07/2025, 23:33 - +44 7562 292419: I think we're often taught to compete to prevent us banding together and actually accomplishing something
25/07/2025, 23:33 - +44 7562 292419: Yeah I here that
25/07/2025, 23:34 - +44 7562 292419: I got halfway applying  and just stopped cause I was exhausted with the process
25/07/2025, 23:34 - +44 7516 029853: A bit. Frenemies is a thing, at least in my life I observed it a lot
25/07/2025, 23:35 - +44 7562 292419: I think you often see guys competing and trying to undermine each other to validate their egos
25/07/2025, 23:35 - onur: I dont agree with you @⁨~Alex S⁩ have u served?
25/07/2025, 23:35 - onur: :D
25/07/2025, 23:35 - +44 7562 292419: I just always bowed out of that nonsense
25/07/2025, 23:35 - +44 7562 292419: Cause it's usually about the most pointless things
25/07/2025, 23:35 - onur: Or did you work in a heavy duty job?
25/07/2025, 23:36 - +44 7599 430972: Women might use deriviative social tools like passive agressiveness and gossip. Men use nagging, off-line public “jokes” and silent treatment
25/07/2025, 23:36 - +44 7599 430972: Yes
25/07/2025, 23:36 - +44 7562 292419: And I've seen that the most successful people tend to be more collaborative
25/07/2025, 23:36 - +44 7599 430972: For 2 years
25/07/2025, 23:36 - +44 7562 292419: At least in science
25/07/2025, 23:36 - onur: What did you think about these when it comes to army?
25/07/2025, 23:36 - +44 7516 029853: Does not sound too different to the behaviours I observed among women, tbh. The form is quite different, but the tension/power struggle is quite similar.
25/07/2025, 23:36 - +44 7599 430972: Worst comes to shine
25/07/2025, 23:36 - +44 7562 292419: Which is the only thing I actually care to compete about 😅
25/07/2025, 23:36 - +44 7599 430972: People throwing tantrums left and right, punching walls, crying
25/07/2025, 23:37 - +44 7599 430972: If anything it made me hate men more
25/07/2025, 23:37 - onur: I think collaboration and competition can coexist
25/07/2025, 23:37 - +353 89 605 0161: There's some pretty brutal bullying scandals coming out of the military every few years
25/07/2025, 23:37 - +44 7562 292419: I agree
25/07/2025, 23:37 - onur: But wasnt there also like banding or bonding etc
25/07/2025, 23:37 - +44 7562 292419: It's the difference between healthy and toxic competition
25/07/2025, 23:37 - +44 7599 430972: Nope we were not having gay sex
25/07/2025, 23:37 - onur: That is true as well
25/07/2025, 23:37 - onur: 😅😅😁
25/07/2025, 23:38 - +44 7562 292419: Competition is not universally good imo
25/07/2025, 23:38 - +44 7562 292419: It's an aspect of how we interact socially
25/07/2025, 23:38 - +44 7562 292419: And can be positive
25/07/2025, 23:39 - onur: If collaboration is the foundation of a building competition is like the rest of it 😅 <This message was edited>
25/07/2025, 23:39 - +44 7516 029853: I think it is <This message was edited>
25/07/2025, 23:39 - +44 7599 430972: Even if some groups did form they mostly formed against common adversary and then broke up once the danger evaded
25/07/2025, 23:39 - +44 7599 430972: I don’t talk to my military friends for example
25/07/2025, 23:39 - +353 89 605 0161: I think skewed sex ratios can up the antisocial behaviour in groups too
25/07/2025, 23:39 - +44 7599 430972: With some uni friends - yea
25/07/2025, 23:39 - +353 89 605 0161: I tried to find the study which supported that idea, baboons I thought, but maybe I made it up 😅
25/07/2025, 23:39 - +44 7516 029853: If there is no competition, there will be no progress, just decay and stagnation.
25/07/2025, 23:39 - onur: Yeah exactly
25/07/2025, 23:40 - onur: Comfort is the enemy of the progress
25/07/2025, 23:40 - onur: Or we have been raised in such a competitive time
25/07/2025, 23:40 - onur: This is what we think now
25/07/2025, 23:40 - onur: Idk
25/07/2025, 23:40 - onur: :D
25/07/2025, 23:41 - +44 7562 292419: I agree but you also need openness and sharing of information to progress
25/07/2025, 23:41 - Will-hazzer777: When will you be willing? What is your criteria?
25/07/2025, 23:41 - onur: Having a place to live
25/07/2025, 23:41 - onur: For starters
25/07/2025, 23:41 - onur: 🤣😅
25/07/2025, 23:41 - +44 7599 430972: I think competition clearly implies fairness
25/07/2025, 23:41 - +44 7516 029853: It is part of a (relatively) healthy competition
25/07/2025, 23:41 - onur: Ooo
25/07/2025, 23:41 - onur: Yeah good point
25/07/2025, 23:41 - +44 7599 430972: A big conglomerate squashing small competitors is not per se competition
25/07/2025, 23:41 - +44 7562 292419: Doesn't it just mean you're competing 😅
25/07/2025, 23:42 - +353 89 605 0161: When the gene manipulation technology can guarantee me ubermensh offspring 💪 <This message was edited>
25/07/2025, 23:42 - onur: No he means that at least there are units that are competing and there are some ground rules which indicate fairness
25/07/2025, 23:42 - +44 7599 430972: If I kill every other man to have all reproductive rights
25/07/2025, 23:42 - +44 7516 029853: No really. Even in the cage-era, only the coolest girls and boys had the best partners. It is quite connected to biology etc
25/07/2025, 23:42 - +44 7599 430972: Competition?
25/07/2025, 23:42 - +44 7599 430972: Or elimination?
25/07/2025, 23:42 - onur: Sex is always about competition tho
25/07/2025, 23:43 - Will-hazzer777: What does that even mean?
25/07/2025, 23:43 - +44 7516 029853: Competition.
25/07/2025, 23:43 - +44 7562 292419: We can absolutely have unfair competition
25/07/2025, 23:43 - +353 89 605 0161: Ubermensh children would understand
25/07/2025, 23:43 - +44 7516 029853: Most of the time we do
25/07/2025, 23:43 - onur: Then one would argue that its not a competition
25/07/2025, 23:44 - +44 7562 292419: I think assuming all competition is fair is like saying  everything works out because it's following god's plan
25/07/2025, 23:44 - Will-hazzer777: But you're not Ubermensch I assume otherwise you wouldn't need gene tech.
25/07/2025, 23:44 - +353 89 605 0161: How dare you!
25/07/2025, 23:44 - +44 7562 292419: We're lacking a definition here 😅
25/07/2025, 23:44 - +44 7516 029853: Maybe the word "control" would be more suitable
25/07/2025, 23:44 - +44 7599 430972: If we say progress stems from competition we need to restrict what competition is
25/07/2025, 23:44 - onur: What makes a competititon competittion? 

Competitors
Competition ground
Ground rules
25/07/2025, 23:44 - +44 7562 292419: Do you mean Nietzsche's Übeemensch?
25/07/2025, 23:44 - onur: Is like a game
25/07/2025, 23:45 - Will-hazzer777: 😂🧬
25/07/2025, 23:45 - +44 7599 430972: Because I can just buy all newest research that may make my product obsolete and destroy it
25/07/2025, 23:45 - +44 7562 292419: I think you only need the first point
25/07/2025, 23:45 - +44 7562 292419: This defines a game which is designed to be fair
25/07/2025, 23:46 - +44 7562 292419: Yes
25/07/2025, 23:46 - +44 7516 029853: I think even fairness isn't a prerequisite, I guess the important component is -the opportunity - to compete
25/07/2025, 23:46 - onur: <Media omitted>
25/07/2025, 23:47 - +44 7599 430972: Opportunity to win is an important component of a fair game!
25/07/2025, 23:47 - onur: Isnt this fairness in the context of competition?
25/07/2025, 23:47 - +44 7599 430972: Actually I just remembered game theory
25/07/2025, 23:47 - onur: It is a game
25/07/2025, 23:47 - +44 7562 292419: I mean none of us are really going to win in a global sense 😅 <This message was edited>
25/07/2025, 23:47 - +44 7599 430972: There are concrete criteria which define whether game reaches optimum or not
25/07/2025, 23:47 - onur: Why did u alienate gaming
25/07/2025, 23:47 - +44 7516 029853: You can be a weaker guy in a cave but still somehow charm a cave-woman by giving her food. But if you come from the 21 century with all the tools, no one can hunt better.
25/07/2025, 23:48 - +44 7516 029853: I would say so
25/07/2025, 23:48 - +44 7516 029853: But fairness is very subjective and culturally-tied
25/07/2025, 23:48 - onur: Fair means blonde as well
25/07/2025, 23:48 - onur: Which is interesting
25/07/2025, 23:48 - onur: XD
25/07/2025, 23:48 - +44 7599 430972: I think fairness is an existence of Nash equilibrium and equal chances at winning
25/07/2025, 23:48 - +44 7562 292419: It's the whole equality of opportunity vs equality of outcome thing 😅
25/07/2025, 23:49 - onur: Or white?
25/07/2025, 23:49 - +44 7562 292419: I think the problem is that we often end in a Nash equilibrium 😂
25/07/2025, 23:49 - +44 7562 292419: Getting all Game theory 😅
25/07/2025, 23:50 - onur: That is interesting that you brought this up
25/07/2025, 23:50 - onur: Non cooperative gaming or trolling
25/07/2025, 23:50 - +44 7516 029853: The language didn't create itself, nor was it preserved by "simple men", yep.
25/07/2025, 23:50 - +44 7562 292419: It's my bias but I hate competition it makes me uncomfortable
25/07/2025, 23:50 - +44 7562 292419: I much prefer feeling like a team player 😅
25/07/2025, 23:51 - onur: It is awkward that is for sure
25/07/2025, 23:51 - onur: It is something to deal with
25/07/2025, 23:51 - +44 7562 292419: And discover new things with other intelligent ppl
25/07/2025, 23:51 - +44 7562 292419: But that's totally my bias
25/07/2025, 23:51 - onur: It cant be avoidable sometimes <This message was edited>
25/07/2025, 23:51 - +44 7562 292419: Not a philosophical stance
25/07/2025, 23:51 - onur: Like in a job interview
25/07/2025, 23:51 - +44 7562 292419: Yeah
25/07/2025, 23:51 - onur: How would you collab with other people
25/07/2025, 23:52 - onur: U cant
25/07/2025, 23:52 - onur: So u have to deal with it
25/07/2025, 23:52 - +44 7516 029853: I like healthy competition, but I had a development trauma (not only ADHD but also being put through classical music training since I was 5 🥲)
25/07/2025, 23:52 - onur: I wish i was traumatized by classical music training
25/07/2025, 23:52 - +44 7562 292419: You have to deal with both
25/07/2025, 23:52 - +44 7562 292419: Oh I'm sorry to hear that 😅
25/07/2025, 23:52 - +44 7516 029853: But I also think most of the time we don't even see examples of healthy (productive) competition
25/07/2025, 23:53 - +44 7562 292419: I think ND trauma can be rough cause it takes decades to even realize why you were being treated as different
25/07/2025, 23:53 - +44 7516 029853: It's just hedgehog trust fund trumps having pints like pigs and promoting each other <This message was edited>
25/07/2025, 23:53 - +44 7562 292419: I couldn't read for a really long time and got bullied for it, so I overcompensate by spending most of my life in a university 😅
25/07/2025, 23:54 - +44 7516 029853: Dyslexia?
25/07/2025, 23:54 - +44 7562 292419: Big time
25/07/2025, 23:54 - +44 7562 292419: But I was weirdly good maths for my age
25/07/2025, 23:54 - +44 7562 292419: So I gravitated towards maths and science
25/07/2025, 23:55 - +44 7562 292419: And now no one knows what I'm talking about 😅
25/07/2025, 23:55 - +44 7516 029853: Really? It was really bad and we were competing with each other from the very beginning of our days at school. Not healthy at all
25/07/2025, 23:55 - onur: That is understandable why u dont like competition
25/07/2025, 23:55 - onur: @⁨~Alex⁩
25/07/2025, 23:56 - onur: Well a lot of things are not healthy
25/07/2025, 23:56 - onur: In a life time
25/07/2025, 23:56 - onur: That is a nice unhealthy thing xD
25/07/2025, 23:56 - onur: Kids dont understand shit
25/07/2025, 23:56 - onur: U wouldnt know what u wanted anyways
25/07/2025, 23:56 - +44 7516 029853: Nah, if I have kids one day, they will code and learn math, not music
25/07/2025, 23:57 - +44 7516 029853: Or sports
25/07/2025, 23:57 - onur: And they will complain about u in a whatsapp group
25/07/2025, 23:57 - onur: Saying how u traumatized them with math and code xD

25/07/2025, 23:58 - onur: Sometimes forcing kids are good
25/07/2025, 23:58 - +44 7516 029853: Lol

But I still vividly remember how kids were having fun outside, but I couldn't join them because I had to practice every single day
25/07/2025, 23:58 - +44 7562 292419: I like competition with myself
25/07/2025, 23:58 - onur: There could be a balance but nowadays kids are spoiled 🤣🤣
25/07/2025, 23:58 - +44 7562 292419: That's why I like studying, coding and doing experiments
25/07/2025, 23:59 - +44 7562 292419: I like challenging my abilities
25/07/2025, 23:59 - +44 7516 029853: I, surprisingly, agree
25/07/2025, 23:59 - onur: This isnt a real competition tho
25/07/2025, 23:59 - +44 7562 292419: It's also why I keep switching fields and applying for the most competitive places I can 😅
25/07/2025, 23:59 - +44 7516 029853: Only if it is healthy. But it can be very productive
25/07/2025, 23:59 - onur: Yeah like some kids are really docile and sweet and they are probably easy to deal with but in general I mean there is chat gpt like come on
25/07/2025, 23:59 - onur: If I had chatgpt when I was a kid
26/07/2025, 00:00 - +44 7516 029853: Today, I was saying the exact sentence to my friends
26/07/2025, 00:00 - onur: Bro I was memorizing encyclopaedias and capital cities of countries and flags etc out of scarce
26/07/2025, 00:00 - onur: Like i was hungry for learning
26/07/2025, 00:00 - onur: And there was no information
26/07/2025, 00:00 - onur: 🤣😅😅😅
26/07/2025, 00:01 - +44 7562 292419: Thinking is harder than memorizing
26/07/2025, 00:01 - +44 7516 029853: And exhausting parents with questions, like "Why is the green green", " how does x work"
26/07/2025, 00:01 - onur: Like your problem with competition i have a problem with thinking
26/07/2025, 00:01 - onur: Yeah hahah samezies and they were not really educated
26/07/2025, 00:02 - onur: I hate thinking because it is all I do xD I cant snap out of it
26/07/2025, 00:02 - onur: I dont want to comment on everything with my inner voice
26/07/2025, 00:02 - onur: Some people just do you know
26/07/2025, 00:02 - onur: I admire that
26/07/2025, 00:03 - +44 7516 029853: I can't memorise unless I use mnemonics, luckily I was taught that at an early age
26/07/2025, 00:03 - +44 7516 029853: Did you go to a regular school?
26/07/2025, 00:03 - +44 7516 029853: Are they good in Turkey?

26/07/2025, 00:04 - onur: What a banger
26/07/2025, 00:04 - onur: Yeah, to be honest they are not awful, and I was a succesful student so I went to good schools later on
26/07/2025, 00:04 - onur: They got worse over time, in my time it was ok
26/07/2025, 00:05 - +44 7516 029853: Also, back to dyslexia, English is a very hard language to master. Especially the written norms
26/07/2025, 00:05 - +44 7516 029853: thought through tough
26/07/2025, 00:05 - +44 7516 029853: God help me!
26/07/2025, 00:05 - onur: But they learn it naturally
26/07/2025, 00:06 - +44 7516 029853: I am sure I saw an article about that, where there was a higher number of kids with dyslexia among English speakers.
26/07/2025, 00:06 - onur: Wow
26/07/2025, 00:07 - +44 7562 292419: Why do you think that this?

26/07/2025, 00:11 - +44 7516 029853: "Similarly, parents’ socioeconomic status (SES) can affect the likelihood a student is identified with dyslexia. A report on parents of children with dyslexia found that 75% had a bachelor's degree or higher (Denton et al., 2022). Additionally, most (60%) of these parents reported that schools did not adequately respond to their requests for dyslexia evaluation, so they paid for a costly, private evaluation."

26/07/2025, 08:59 - +44 7958 612614: your generalisation doesn’t hold water.  If you have a table circular saw - you only need to bring it down to the wood and your cut will be straighter and faster than anyone can do by hand
26/07/2025, 09:02 - +44 7958 612614: Where I am at the moment there’s a lot of nonsense that you hear from people - they get fed by some right-wing disinformation on Facebook or elsewhere.  The latest nonsense I got told was that car manufacturers that produce cars using the AI and robots have 50% discard rate - every 1,000 cars they make - they have to destroy 500 because of quality control issues.  I also found out that (apparently) Ukrainian war is about stopping Muslims getting into the power there.  The sheer amount of stupid conspiracy theories that I have to endure with a serious face makes me depressed…. @⁨Will-hazzer777⁩ - you'd thrive here!
26/07/2025, 10:27 - +44 7516 029853: I am tired of being an adult 🥲.

26/07/2025, 13:50 - onur: The funny thing is hitler was kind of a dumb guy who doesnt deserve neither the praise or the hate
26/07/2025, 13:50 - onur: :D
26/07/2025, 14:25 - Parag-meetup: Day after tomorrow
26/07/2025, 14:25 - Parag-meetup: Monday evening
26/07/2025, 14:26 - Will-hazzer777: He was a good orator... And he won some battles through novel tactics of his own devising which his generals didn't think we're possible. He got too big for his boots like Napoleon.
26/07/2025, 14:45 - +44 7516 029853: Did you know that the Romanian language has a separate word for it? (poimâine)
Ukrainian too (післязавтра)
26/07/2025, 14:52 - onur: Which one?
26/07/2025, 14:52 - onur: He never gave war tactics except for changing direction from moscow to stalingrad
26/07/2025, 14:52 - onur: And that was a mistake
26/07/2025, 14:54 - onur: In turkish too
26/07/2025, 14:54 - onur: Also for the day before
26/07/2025, 14:55 - onur: One of the biggest gap in english is that there isnt a word for “what number in the order?”
26/07/2025, 14:55 - onur: Like for example what number of president Trump is
26/07/2025, 14:56 - onur: Sounds lame
26/07/2025, 14:56 - onur: It needs its own word like which or when ;D
26/07/2025, 14:56 - onur: Or which position did you finish the race
26/07/2025, 14:56 - onur: Sounds lame
26/07/2025, 14:57 - onur: And you have to use different terminology for each case etc
26/07/2025, 14:59 - onur: Modern English doesn’t have a single, dedicated interrogative word that asks “what number in an ordered sequence” — like we have “who” for people or “when” for time. Instead, we have to use clunky phrases like:
	•	What number president is Trump?
	•	What place did you finish?
	•	What rank is she in the list?

Did Old English have a word for this?

Short answer: Not exactly, but it handled it more consistently through inflected forms and word roots.

Old English used ordinal numbers (like þridda for “third”) and sometimes employed constructions like:
	•	“hwelc” (which/what kind) + context
	•	Or phrases like “on þam fyrmestan stede” (in the foremost place)

But there was no dedicated single word for “what ordinal number?” either.

⸻

Other languages that do have a word for this:

Some languages are more elegant here:
	•	Turkish: “kaçıncı” – directly means “whatth” or “which-numbered”
	•	Japanese: “何番目 (nanbanme)” – literally “what number in order”
	•	Russian: “какой по счёту?” – “which by count/order?”

English just never coined an equivalent like “whordinal” (joking but plausible).

⸻

What could English adopt?

You could coin a neologism like:
	•	“whordinal” = what ordinal number?
	•	“rankwhich” = what rank?
	•	“whichth” = what-th one in order?

It’s genuinely a real lexical hole. Your rant is valid.
26/07/2025, 14:59 - onur: Whichth is really good
26/07/2025, 14:59 - onur: :D
26/07/2025, 14:59 - onur: I would use it
26/07/2025, 14:59 - onur: And makes sense
26/07/2025, 16:53 - +44 7958 612614: There’s a strong Latin component in Romanian - probably comes from  poi domani ?

26/07/2025, 17:14 - +44 7516 029853: Oh, of course. It is a language, based on Latin (the consequence of being occupied by the Roman Empire)
26/07/2025, 17:27 - +44 7958 612614: Our language is Slavic, but because of the mixing with the local Roman population - it has a similar rhythm to Italian. Sometimes when I cannot hear clearly - I can’t be sure which is which.

27/07/2025, 11:07 - Parag-meetup: Interesting 
Never understood why would anyone prefer working from home !
27/07/2025, 11:25 - +44 7958 612614: commuting saps energy, depending on the environment - you might need to be extra vigilant / alert because you’re being watched and that tires you.  When you end your work - you’re knackered to do something creative at home.  Socialising is good though.
27/07/2025, 11:26 - Parag-meetup: So it’s just the commute ?
27/07/2025, 11:30 - +44 7958 612614: no, being monitored visually as well
27/07/2025, 11:31 - +44 7958 612614: you can’t go around in knickers
27/07/2025, 11:31 - +44 7958 612614: you can’t openly drink alcohol in the office

27/07/2025, 11:32 - +44 7516 029853: Neuro divergencies. Offices are rarely well-designed, and there is too much noise and distraction.
Also, don't feel like everyone is watching what you do
27/07/2025, 11:33 - +44 7516 029853: Lunch is a complicated thing if you're in the office, while at home you can even slowly cook while working
27/07/2025, 11:33 - +44 7958 612614: You can eat slowly as well
27/07/2025, 11:35 - +44 7958 612614: but neuro divergencies is a great point.  The environments should be classified along neuro divergencies’ spectrums
27/07/2025, 11:37 - +44 7958 612614: I met a very successful Austrian guy who runs a company of 180 people.  He’s around 60 and is planning to retire soon (pass the company to his daughters).  While being a “new ager”, he’s also very introverted and plans to spend his retirement dedicating time to himself and his niche interests.  He’s got a list of 250 books to read and visit places around the world, but not to meet other people, to turn more inwards.
27/07/2025, 12:07 - onur: Tell him to give me a job

28/07/2025, 22:24 - Will-hazzer777: He can insult Sadsack all he likes for all I care.
28/07/2025, 22:25 - onur: still he is an elected mayor of the capital cit
28/07/2025, 22:25 - onur: y
28/07/2025, 22:31 - Will-hazzer777: There's far too many people in politics that's all I have to say... Too many layers... Just because someone is elected doesn't mean anything... Nigel Farage is elected, doesn't mean people can't or shouldn't show their dislike or disapproval of him if they so choose.
28/07/2025, 22:33 - +44 7516 029853: Buses in London are cheaper than in Edinburgh 1.75 vs 2.20), and you have a 60-minute window (in Edinburgh, there is only capping, which is also more expensive 5:50 vs 5:25).
I take no hatred towards the man, nor should you
28/07/2025, 22:34 - onur: So its the bus prices
28/07/2025, 22:35 - +44 7516 029853: One of the examples
28/07/2025, 22:35 - +44 7516 029853: But it's essential
28/07/2025, 22:36 - Will-hazzer777: https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cgl0kp69d6jo


It's not free! It's done at public expense... Your cheap bus fares mean that money has to be taken from something else... It's all jiggery pokery nonsense... Robbing Peter to pay Paul!
28/07/2025, 22:36 - +44 7459 510589: There's also stabbing and phone thefts. All the good stuffs

28/07/2025, 22:42 - onur: How? Its already expensive and millions of people use it everyday
28/07/2025, 22:43 - onur: Its really a success to make tfl fail in terms of finances
28/07/2025, 22:43 - Will-hazzer777: Because London is unsustainable.
28/07/2025, 22:43 - +44 7516 029853: The mayor personally introduced the population to stabbing and theft, right?
28/07/2025, 22:43 - onur: While everything is a shitshow
28/07/2025, 22:43 - onur: Literally tfl is one of the worst things about london and it still loses money?

28/07/2025, 22:44 - +44 7516 029853: It's still not enough. Partially bcs it's an incredibly expensive system to run, but also bcs of nationalisation of the rail
28/07/2025, 22:44 - onur: What is expensive to run?
28/07/2025, 22:44 - +44 7516 029853: The tube
28/07/2025, 22:45 - onur: How???

28/07/2025, 22:45 - Will-hazzer777: He turns a blind eye... To win votes and not piss off various communities. What's a few deaths? If it keeps the mob voting for you? You're going to stop the implementation of stop and search orders in particular areas in order not to offend.

28/07/2025, 22:53 - +44 7516 029853: Absolutely. I have been in NYC before London and was projecting on London how unsafe a metropolitan city tends to be. It was an absolute shock to me to feel ok going home alone at 3 am. I wouldn't dare do that even in the safest parts of New York
28/07/2025, 22:53 - Will-hazzer777: Nice one
28/07/2025, 22:53 - onur: yeah I wouldn't do that in NY hahha even rats are acting up at those hours
28/07/2025, 22:54 - Will-hazzer777: These numbers need looking at because there's a difference between budgeted costs and actual end of year results.
28/07/2025, 23:00 - +44 7516 029853: I once stayed at my friend's flat in Brooklyn. It was in a relatively safe area, seen as seriously gentrified. A caveat: "relatively safe" in American terms is selling drugs in the streets after 8pm, not before lunch. 
I was walking home from the subway, passing by people queuing to buy some serious drugs. It was 8:20pm or something.

Answered by Claude AI 🙃:
"The mayoral and local governance structures in New York City and London reflect fundamentally different approaches to urban administration, shaped by their distinct political traditions and administrative philosophies.Executive Power and StructureNew York's mayor operates within a strong-mayor system, wielding considerable executive authority over city operations. The mayor directly controls most city agencies, from the police department to education, and has significant budget-setting powers. This creates a centralized command structure where major decisions flow through City Hall.London's mayor, by contrast, works within a more distributed system. The Mayor of London oversees strategic city-wide issues like transport, housing policy, and economic development, but lacks direct control over many services that New York's mayor manages. The mayor shares power with 32 borough councils plus the City of London Corporation, each maintaining substantial autonomy over local services.Local Council DynamicsNew York's borough system functions more as administrative divisions than independent governing bodies. While borough presidents exist, they have limited powers compared to the mayor. The City Council serves as the legislative body, but the mayor's executive authority remains dominant in most policy areas.London's borough councils operate as genuine local governments with elected leaders and significant independence. Each borough manages its own housing, social services, waste collection, and local planning decisions. This creates a more federated approach where the Mayor of London must coordinate with dozens of separate authorities rather than direct them.Policy ImplementationThis structural difference profoundly affects how policies are implemented. New York's mayor can often implement city-wide initiatives relatively quickly through direct agency control. When Mayor Bloomberg wanted to expand bike lanes or when Mayor de Blasio launched universal pre-K, they could leverage centralized authority.London's mayor must build consensus across multiple borough councils to achieve city-wide change. Transport for London represents one area where the mayor has direct authority, but housing or social services require negotiation and coordination with individual boroughs that may have different political priorities.Democratic AccountabilityThe systems also create different accountability structures. New York voters can clearly assign responsibility to the mayor for most city services, creating direct electoral consequences for performance. London's more distributed system can make accountability more complex, as residents must navigate between borough-level and mayoral responsibilities when evaluating governance.Both systems have evolved to address the unique challenges of governing major global cities, but they represent distinctly different philosophies about centralization versus local autonomy in urban governance."
28/07/2025, 23:14 - +44 7516 029853: it's hilarious that it says "disturbed system" instead of "fragmented", "independent".
28/07/2025, 23:22 - Will-hazzer777: It says "distributed" not "disturbed"
28/07/2025, 23:23 - +44 7516 029853: Here is proof that I am tired and have dyslexia 😊
28/07/2025, 23:23 - +44 7459 510589: Thanks. That covers it all. Different foundations, different outcomes
29/07/2025, 08:17 - +44 7958 612614: selling drugs comes under commerce.  it's good for people to be entrepreneural
29/07/2025, 08:37 - +44 7516 029853: Supports the American spirit, yeah
29/07/2025, 09:02 - +44 7958 612614: Not selling drugs before lunch comes under licensing laws.  In the UK there were strict rules once about selling alcohol - and supermarkets would pull down the drapes over booze aisles to stop people buying them at certain times.  That was before science discovered that alcohol is good for you
29/07/2025, 09:13 - +44 7562 292419: That last sentence needs a citation 😂

29/07/2025, 09:46 - +44 7516 029853: Btw, can't buy alcohol after 10pm in Scotland
29/07/2025, 09:49 - +44 7958 612614: order from Amazon
29/07/2025, 09:53 - +44 7516 029853: can't order alcohol delivery either, unless it's an illegal business
29/07/2025, 09:54 - +44 7516 029853: just go to pubs
29/07/2025, 09:54 - +44 7516 029853: however most of them close at 11
29/07/2025, 10:01 - +44 7958 612614: why?  I order alcohol from Amazon
29/07/2025, 10:02 - +44 7958 612614: it’s prohibitively expensive to drink at pubs

Sunday, lunch with a friend to discuss a trip to Amsterdam in September, then bbq in the park with other friends in the evening.

Not a pub in sight.

Am going ice skating this evening. Pub quiz tomorrow...

30/07/2025, 16:43 - Will-hazzer777: Well there are a mixture of looks in the middle east. Plus if the rumours hold any water his father was a Roman centurion called Panthera from Sidon Lebanon.
30/07/2025, 16:43 - +44 7958 612614: rumours?
30/07/2025, 16:44 - Will-hazzer777: Yeah rumours
30/07/2025, 16:45 - +44 7958 612614: how can you have “rumours” reverberating from ancient history?

30/07/2025, 16:46 - Will-hazzer777: So yes he would have been a bit more bronzed.
30/07/2025, 16:46 - +44 7516 029853: the excuse was "you are young and healthy, you do not need another boost"
30/07/2025, 16:46 - +44 7958 612614: you go, girl!!!!
30/07/2025, 16:47 - Will-hazzer777: Why were you refused to be double boosted?
30/07/2025, 16:47 - +44 7516 029853: that is what nurses said, but obviously they are hiding something
30/07/2025, 16:48 - +44 7958 612614: They look Greek, Roman, Italian, Arabic, Spanish, Mexican….  above all - they look human.   The evidence that you bring to the table is not very useful.
30/07/2025, 16:48 - Will-hazzer777: That they knew one was enough...
30/07/2025, 16:48 - Will-hazzer777: Why? Jesus was fully human. <This message was edited>

30/07/2025, 16:49 - Will-hazzer777: We're discussing what jesus looked like
30/07/2025, 16:50 - +44 7958 612614: why would he look like roman era egyptian nobility?  Or why would he not look like them?
30/07/2025, 16:50 - +44 7516 029853: I had Johnson first. I travelled to my home country to get it. It was awful. My choice is the Pfizer booster I got in the UK. Felt nothing, as if was not vaccinated
30/07/2025, 16:51 - +44 7958 612614: are you happy now that you got vaccinated?
30/07/2025, 16:51 - +44 7958 612614: I know, a stupid question 😉
30/07/2025, 16:51 - Will-hazzer777: You didn't react well to the monkey virus... Shame...
30/07/2025, 16:51 - +44 7516 029853: I would rather have 10 vaccinations than to experience lockdowns again
30/07/2025, 16:51 - +44 7958 612614: I didn’t have any vaccines and didn’t experience lockdowns...
30/07/2025, 16:52 - +44 7516 029853: Whaaat? Where were you those years?
30/07/2025, 16:52 - Will-hazzer777: We all had Johnson... Boris Johnson...
30/07/2025, 16:52 - +44 7958 612614: In Lodon and Western Europe
30/07/2025, 16:53 - +44 7958 612614: travelled freely like a bird, had to run up the stairs at Ikea when security guards were not looking, hide in the toilets in Italy when inspection was checking certificates at restaurants, but apart from that - didn’t feel it at all.  If anything, I enjoyed the outdoors more <This message was edited>
30/07/2025, 16:54 - +44 7958 612614: lockdowns were all psychological (at least in the UK) - elsewhere it was a bit more real
30/07/2025, 16:54 - +44 7516 029853: But they were checking the certificates in order to travel, how did you manage to avoid that?
30/07/2025, 16:55 - Will-hazzer777: No vacation without vaccination
30/07/2025, 16:55 - +44 7516 029853: Exactly <This message was edited>
30/07/2025, 16:55 - +44 7958 612614: I suppose they made an exception whenever it was my turn… No, everyone was talking about how they were checking, but they weren’t.  I had a few times certificate that I didn’t have covid when travelling by plane, but even that wasn’t enforced religiously
30/07/2025, 16:55 - +44 7958 612614: nonsense, I drove multiple times through Europe from UK and never got asked for one.  That was at the time when it was strictest
30/07/2025, 16:56 - +44 7516 029853: Speaking of corruption. I was for a few weeks in Ukraine during Covid. Police was occasionally checking the certificates. They even spent extra time to double check my foreign certificate for authenticity.
30/07/2025, 16:57 - +44 7958 612614: corruption - my favourite subject ❤️
30/07/2025, 16:59 - +44 7516 029853: I do not know how it was working for you (I believe you). Perhaps it was some kind of white male privilege magic, but I remember very well that I was asked to show the certificate in public places in the UK multiple times, including in a club.
30/07/2025, 17:00 - +44 7958 612614: Looking back at Covid times - that’s when this global move towards autocracy started.  A great excuse for legitimising protocols for public dissent.
30/07/2025, 17:00 - +44 7516 029853: They also asked me to show my ID each time I wanted to buy alcohol. Had to order a Proof of Age ID.
30/07/2025, 17:01 - +44 7958 612614: because you look so young, i woudln’t complain
30/07/2025, 17:01 - +44 7516 029853: Dark times, indeed. But I do not agree that it was when they started autocracy, just executed it quite obviously.
30/07/2025, 17:02 - +44 7516 029853: I do not have a beard, that helps, I guess.
30/07/2025, 17:04 - +44 7958 612614: Our normativity and judiciary are all about precedents.  You create a precedent, you don’t get a strong reaction, you keep on pushing.  That’s how it works, but most people don’t get it.  When people get off their asses to act - it’s too late because society has become culturally conditioned and scared
30/07/2025, 17:06 - +44 7516 029853: > Our normativity and judiciary are all about precedents. You create a precedent, you don’t get a strong reaction, you keep on pushing. 
I must agree, unfortunately.

I am by no means a Covid denier and I am genuinely pro vaccination, but I strongly believe lockdowns were not just harmful, they damaged every aspect of society they could.
30/07/2025, 17:08 - Will-hazzer777: That was the point and the vaccines were there to ruin people's health and make many infertile or subfertile.
30/07/2025, 17:08 - Will-hazzer777: Especially in the western world.
30/07/2025, 17:09 - Will-hazzer777: It's was a controlled demolition of the world as we knew it.
30/07/2025, 17:09 - +44 7958 612614: you should have become a drama actor 🤣
30/07/2025, 17:09 - +44 7958 612614: there are million bad things in the world - and you fixate on 2 only - immigration and Covid vaccines
30/07/2025, 17:09 - Will-hazzer777: It's just a matter of time before for the building collapses... It's a slow collapse over a decade or two.
30/07/2025, 17:10 - Will-hazzer777: Important things...
30/07/2025, 17:10 - +44 7958 612614: yeah, and when it doesn’t happen - you’ll just extend that to 3 decades, 4, 5...
30/07/2025, 17:10 - +44 7958 612614: you’ll never be wrong without ever being right
30/07/2025, 17:12 - +44 7958 612614: It’s like you get invested in your “theories” - and you don’t let them die, because all that investment goes to waste
30/07/2025, 17:16 - Will-hazzer777: Currently the trajectory of excess deaths will peak by 2031 in the England and Wales... But we're only half way through the process based on current trajectories... What's yet to be seen is how people's health will be in 2031, 10 years after the vaccine roll out, and how it compares to people in 2019 who were of a similar age.

Similarly with the birth rates... Clearly if correct most of the births that take place will be from mother's who are not of a western origin. As such much of the replacement of western populations along with their culture and expectations in life will start to come to a close by mid century.
30/07/2025, 17:16 - +44 7958 612614: whatever, what happened, happened - what will happen, will happen...
30/07/2025, 17:17 - +44 7958 612614: and we’ll never learn anything from it
30/07/2025, 17:17 - +44 7958 612614: and your “I told you so” will not be appreciated by anyone - they’ll hate you more then
30/07/2025, 17:17 - +44 7958 612614: lol, such a waste hoping to get some credit for speculating about things…
30/07/2025, 17:18 - Will-hazzer777: Well we have 6 years... Or as Liz Truss said in her 2024 book, ten years to save the west.
30/07/2025, 17:18 - +44 7958 612614: right, you will save anything??
30/07/2025, 17:18 - Will-hazzer777: Well by your own admission, you didn't take the vaccines... So clearly you sensed something was afoot.
30/07/2025, 17:18 - Will-hazzer777: No it's quite likely too late.
30/07/2025, 17:19 - Will-hazzer777: The pieces will have to be gathered up after the fact...
30/07/2025, 17:19 - +44 7958 612614: again, what’s that to do with anything?  We do what we do, what we’re compelled to do, what seems right at the time - and we either profit or lose out of our decisions
30/07/2025, 17:19 - Will-hazzer777: What was your reasoning?
30/07/2025, 17:20 - Will-hazzer777: For what reason did you not have the jabs? Laziness? Couldn't get to the clinic on time?
30/07/2025, 17:23 - Will-hazzer777: https://youtu.be/MjVVw841eUo
30/07/2025, 17:26 - +44 7958 612614: just didn’t feel like it… but why is it important why I had or didn’t have jabs?
30/07/2025, 17:27 - Will-hazzer777: Such a liar
30/07/2025, 17:27 - +44 7958 612614: what do you mean?
30/07/2025, 17:28 - Will-hazzer777: I just didn't feel like it... Isn't a response... Why didn't you feel like it?
30/07/2025, 17:28 - +44 7958 612614: you wake up in the morning - someone asks you to go and play some basketball - you don’t feel like it - you don’t do it
30/07/2025, 17:29 - +44 7958 612614: I’m not an analytical type - i always act out of my gut feelings - feel like it or don’t feel like it
30/07/2025, 17:29 - +44 7958 612614: simplez
30/07/2025, 17:30 - Will-hazzer777: I understand that on one particular day, you can't be arsed to roll out and be active... That's an excuse... But you had years, literally years to take it.... What long term non-feeling is that?
30/07/2025, 17:31 - Will-hazzer777: Well all I can say is that your gut is more of a conspiracy theorist than you are... That's all I can presume.
30/07/2025, 17:32 - +44 7958 612614: I never felt like it - but…. after encountering a few times difficulties getting into restaurants - I went to get one and the nurse was fuffing about my european health card insurance - and I told her:  this is ridiculous - it’s like Pablo Escobar walking into a police station to surrender and the police can’t be bothered to process him… and I walked out - heavens spoke to me
30/07/2025, 17:33 - +44 7958 612614: yep, I believe that life guides you - and I act according to the feedback from the heavens
30/07/2025, 17:33 - Will-hazzer777: Ahh so it wasn't anything to do with how you were feeling... It was just red tape that stopped you.
30/07/2025, 17:33 - +44 7958 612614: that was when i woke up one day and felt like going …
30/07/2025, 17:34 - +44 7958 612614: I generally don’t like doing anything others do
30/07/2025, 17:34 - +44 7958 612614: until I think it’s time to try it - it’s called wisdom - delayed reaction
30/07/2025, 17:34 - Will-hazzer777: I agree with that to an extent... Should try and go with the flow as much as possible. If you're cutting against the grain too much it's probably not the right move.
30/07/2025, 17:35 - +44 7958 612614: yep, I’m adamantly against that - i refer to it like being carried by the river and instead of trying to fight the flow and swimming against it - you just relax and wait until youi see the river branching off - then you see how you feel about taking the left or the right branch...
30/07/2025, 17:36 - +44 7958 612614: most people fight any change (youi included)
30/07/2025, 17:36 - Will-hazzer777: I try my best to never go too much out of my way for anything... It should be easy, it usually feels right...
30/07/2025, 17:37 - +44 7958 612614: change is to be welcomed - like trying to swim in freezing water - you let the cold in, otherwise you’re in trouble.  It’s counterintuitive , but that’s wisdom
30/07/2025, 17:40 - Will-hazzer777: I don't fight... I definitely go with the flow... I'm just capable of identifying when choices needs to be made. And doing whichever feels right... The difference between you and I is that you're a pure isolated individualist and just work with environments you are given... I'm not and try and do what I can to mould my environments around what I think is in my interest, that includes other people.
30/07/2025, 17:41 - +44 7958 612614: fair enough.
30/07/2025, 17:41 - Will-hazzer777: I count people as part of my environment that I have some influence on moulding, you don't. You're the guy who gets off the titanic without working collaboratively. I think more collaboratively.
30/07/2025, 17:47 - +44 7958 612614: what you’re missing on is that even if you have influence on their moulding (which I doubt you have) - it doesn ’t matter how they are moulded - it’s because vast majority of people don’t matter at all - they don’t change the ways of the world - they only change the attitude towards the ways of the world
30/07/2025, 17:51 - Will-hazzer777: - You don't know unless you try.
- I don't agree with your second premise. I don't believe people are interchangeable like you do.
- People behave differently based on your framing of things. You can't change their responses, like you can't change easily the responses of a key pad... But you can play with the buttons.

31/07/2025, 19:30 - +44 7562 292419: I think for me cooking is very meditative

31/07/2025, 19:30 - +44 7562 292419: But I love doing complicated recipes
31/07/2025, 19:31 - +44 7516 029853: I am the opposite. I hate cooking and like cleaning.
31/07/2025, 19:32 - +44 7562 292419: I've noticed that a lot of people are usually only one of those things
31/07/2025, 19:33 - +44 7516 029853: Yeah, that is why if someone is considering a serious relationship, they need to assess not only values, compatibility, etc, but also this particular aspect. Someone needs to clean and someone needs to cook.
31/07/2025, 19:34 - +44 7516 029853: It can also work if both hate cooking and cleaning, but they share the chores equally. But it is not ideal (speaking from experience) <This message was edited>
31/07/2025, 19:40 - +44 7562 292419: Yeah for sure

31/07/2025, 19:41 - +44 7562 292419: But I could cook for hours

31/07/2025, 19:42 - +44 7516 029853: A healthy compromise with myself. I can force myself to cut ingredients, but that is the maximum I can do.

31/07/2025, 19:48 - +44 7562 292419: They're bigger, fresher and we have different species that are sweeter than what you get in Europe
31/07/2025, 19:49 - +44 7516 029853: I miss tomatoes from my home country. But recently the taste changed, I swear it was much tastier in my childhood, so I am good
31/07/2025, 19:50 - +44 7562 292419: Oh really
31/07/2025, 19:50 - +44 7562 292419: That's interesting
31/07/2025, 19:50 - onur: there are times that I eat cold a few days in a row and I always find myself wanting something hot
31/07/2025, 19:52 - +44 7516 029853: That's a habit. In my childhood, I used to have at least 1 hot meal a day and thought it was impossible to rely on salads only.
31/07/2025, 19:53 - +44 7562 292419: I heard in Eastern Europe under communism fruit was a real luxury
31/07/2025, 19:53 - +44 7562 292419: I had a Hungarian friend who said they only had oranges as a Christmas present
31/07/2025, 19:53 - +44 7516 029853: How old is the friend?
31/07/2025, 19:54 - +44 7562 292419: 40s I think
31/07/2025, 19:56 - +44 7516 029853: I was born after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Pineapples were in deficit, but it was slowly becoming more accessible. By the time I was more or less capable of storing memories, the shortage of tropical fruits was negligible. Local fruits were always accessible in my childhood. though
31/07/2025, 19:58 - +44 7562 292419: That's nice
31/07/2025, 19:58 - +44 7562 292419: I would have died without fruit in Australia
31/07/2025, 19:58 - +44 7562 292419: 😅😂
31/07/2025, 19:59 - onur: When I was a kid tropical fruits were scarce as well like banana coconut mango etc I haven’t eaten mango up until I was 20 or smth xD
31/07/2025, 20:00 - +44 7562 292419: Do you think communism was completely a bad idea or do you think it had some merit ?
31/07/2025, 20:00 - onur: But lucky for me i dont like banana
31/07/2025, 20:00 - +44 7562 292419: I've met people with a wide array of opinions but I noticed that the pro communists tended to be from Western Europe
31/07/2025, 20:00 - onur: Even marx wasnt marxist
31/07/2025, 20:00 - +44 7562 292419: In my experience 😅
31/07/2025, 20:01 - +44 7516 029853: As an idea, it is solid and appealing, but history has proven that in reality, it is always absolutely horrible. However, I must admit there were a few good implemented ideas (public healthcare coverage, jobs for disabled people, etc). Still, it was horrible.
31/07/2025, 20:02 - +44 7516 029853: I am so lucky I was born after the collapse. I would definitely have a much more challenging life for sure.
31/07/2025, 20:03 - +44 7562 292419: I heard that a lot of communist countries had better gender equality (women in professional positions for example)
31/07/2025, 20:03 - +44 7516 029853: Yeah, because their understanding is predominantly based on theory, not practice
31/07/2025, 20:03 - onur: Info about jobs for disabled people is wrong
31/07/2025, 20:03 - onur: I think
31/07/2025, 20:03 - onur: :D
31/07/2025, 20:03 - +44 7516 029853: I like the idea of libertarianism; however, it is more than obvious that it should not be implemented in real countries yet.
31/07/2025, 20:04 - onur: https://www.rbth.com/history/334286-why-were-disabled-people-persecuted-ussr
31/07/2025, 20:04 - onur: <Media omitted>
31/07/2025, 20:04 - +44 7516 029853: What do you mean? There were factories for visually impaired people.
31/07/2025, 20:04 - onur: Where?
31/07/2025, 20:04 - +44 7516 029853: In my home country and in Ukraine for sure <This message was edited>
31/07/2025, 20:05 - +44 7516 029853: I did not say people with disabilities were favoured, I said the gov did provide many of them jobs. And this particular idea is great.
31/07/2025, 20:06 - onur: Do you consider auschwitz as a job opportunity as well?
31/07/2025, 20:06 - onur: 😅🤣
31/07/2025, 20:07 - +44 7516 029853: This too. Even nowadays, the only benefit for East Germany of having been under the Soviets is that the pay gap is significantly lower.
31/07/2025, 20:07 - +44 7562 292419: But that's not communist
31/07/2025, 20:07 - onur: Providing jobs for jews and disabled and gays while no one is giving them a chance
31/07/2025, 20:07 - +44 7562 292419: 😅
31/07/2025, 20:07 - onur: Idk bro i dont think disabled people were given job opportunities in soviet russia :D
31/07/2025, 20:07 - +44 7516 029853: 🤓I would vote for that
31/07/2025, 20:09 - +44 7562 292419: I just found it surprising that ppl that refer to themselves as communists didn't seem interested in seeking out and hearing from people who lived under it
31/07/2025, 20:10 - +44 7562 292419: I kind of thought that meant they weren't serious about their beliefs
31/07/2025, 20:10 - onur: communism was actually never happened
31/07/2025, 20:10 - onur: they'll say
31/07/2025, 20:10 - onur: :D
31/07/2025, 20:12 - +44 7516 029853: The Soviet Union was quite different depending on a particular republic.
Ukraine has an incredibly fertile soil, so locals (after Russians killed millions in the man-made famine Holodomor) could still have, though partially, the benefits of proximity to food and harvest. Same for Moldova, Georgia, etc. Russia is not that fertile despite its size, so they tried to control agriculture as much as possible, but many republics still had access to food (though often persecuted). <This message was edited>
31/07/2025, 20:12 - onur: they were twisted ideologies of evil men :(

or stalin was good but the others were above description

or X was good but Y was evil 

true communism is an utopia but something to strive for

did worker class disappear? nah bro you me we are all workers
31/07/2025, 20:13 - onur: <Media omitted>
31/07/2025, 20:14 - +44 7562 292419: Yeah I heard Ukraine and Kazakhstan basically fed the whole soviet union
31/07/2025, 20:14 - +44 7516 029853: Moldova too, but we were tiny.
31/07/2025, 20:14 - +44 7516 029853: Still contributed to the economy with the tastiest grapes
31/07/2025, 20:15 - onur: after the soil reform the fertility of the land doesn't matter people share like more than 50% with government
31/07/2025, 20:15 - +44 7516 029853: Btw, miss grapes from Moldova.
31/07/2025, 20:16 - +44 7562 292419: Are they really good?
31/07/2025, 20:17 - +44 7516 029853: The best!
31/07/2025, 20:17 - +44 7516 029853: Better than Australian mangoes (sorry, not sorry)
31/07/2025, 20:18 - +44 7562 292419: Damn 😅😅😅
31/07/2025, 20:18 - +44 7562 292419: Ok I'm going to Moldova
31/07/2025, 20:18 - +44 7562 292419: It's settled 😂😂😂
31/07/2025, 20:21 - +44 7516 029853: Right after landing, go there https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mile%C8%99tii_Mici_(winery)
31/07/2025, 20:22 - +44 7562 292419: Philosophical roadtrip to Moldova. Who's down 😂😂😂
31/07/2025, 20:29 - onur: https://dice.fm/event/avo237-boiler-room-london-saturday-2nd-aug-burgess-park-london-tickets
31/07/2025, 20:29 - onur: I'm going to this
31/07/2025, 20:30 - onur: unfortunately brutalismus isn't coming
31/07/2025, 20:30 - onur: :((((
31/07/2025, 20:31 - +44 7516 029853: like them and I Hate Models
31/07/2025, 20:32 - onur: same I don't know the rest
31/07/2025, 20:32 - onur: :D
31/07/2025, 20:32 - onur: <Media omitted>
31/07/2025, 20:32 - onur: i go see these
31/07/2025, 21:32 - +44 7562 292419: What have the main topics been at the philosophy meetup?
31/07/2025, 21:52 - onur: should we try to make our lives fairer?
31/07/2025, 21:52 - +44 7562 292419: How?
31/07/2025, 21:52 - onur: you tell me
31/07/2025, 21:52 - onur: :D
31/07/2025, 21:52 - onur: that's the question
31/07/2025, 21:52 - onur: that we discussed the penultimate time
31/07/2025, 21:53 - +44 7562 292419: I think it comes from communities
31/07/2025, 21:53 - onur: can I say this? :D
31/07/2025, 21:53 - +44 7562 292419: And preventing people from exploiting one another
31/07/2025, 21:54 - +44 7562 292419: There should be limits on how much poorer or richer one can be from the median IMO <This message was edited>
31/07/2025, 21:54 - +44 7562 292419: Since money affords not only comfort but also power
31/07/2025, 21:54 - onur: I think this question boils down in who is deciding what's fair?
31/07/2025, 21:55 - +44 7562 292419: And too much power concentrated among few people leads to the breakdown of society and human decency 😅
31/07/2025, 21:56 - +44 7562 292419: Competition is fine, but every system needs limits
31/07/2025, 21:56 - +44 7562 292419: You shouldn't be able to starve to death in a world with such abundance
31/07/2025, 21:56 - +44 7889 480662: Everything needs a limit if you don't have limits there's only uncontrolled chaos
31/07/2025, 21:56 - +44 7562 292419: Yeah
31/07/2025, 21:56 - +44 7562 292419: And our current world is meant to be controlled chaos
31/07/2025, 21:56 - +44 7562 292419: And it's working out swimmingly 😅
31/07/2025, 21:57 - +44 7889 480662: I mean that's the thing the world is full of chaos you know with how many beautiful rare and mind fuck phenomena that our world has it is chaos on a magnificent level
31/07/2025, 21:58 - onur: chaos mean something
31/07/2025, 21:58 - +44 7889 480662: Well yes chaos is the opposite to order in all forms
31/07/2025, 21:59 - onur: The theory was summarized by Edward Lorenz as:

Chaos: When the present determines the future but the approximate present does not approximately determine the future.
31/07/2025, 22:00 - onur: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_theory#:~:text=The%20theory%20was%20summarized%20by,heartbeat%20irregularities%2C%20weather%20and%20climate.
31/07/2025, 22:00 - +44 7889 480662: That is a really great quote very good use of it
31/07/2025, 22:02 - onur: so yes I think chaos is our normal, like what we engage in real life when you think about it, we are trying to build a scaffolding around it to navigate. 

When it comes to being fair, I guess it works similarly with equality, something to strive for, or to die for, or it is just a concept and we are looking at it in a wrong way
31/07/2025, 22:03 - onur: for a muslim being fair is eye for an eye
31/07/2025, 22:04 - +44 7889 480662: I mean who is defining these rules on fair is it the universe itself is it the human that is governing universes knowledge what is controlling what is fair and what is unfair that's the thing being fair and unfair is like talking about luck and bad luck there is no true definitive example of it
31/07/2025, 22:05 - onur: yeah it seems to be a simple question but u can frame it differently
31/07/2025, 22:05 - onur: when I arrived people were talking about disabilities for example
31/07/2025, 22:06 - +44 7889 480662: Well as a person who is disabled in body and in mind I know how difficult it can be
31/07/2025, 22:06 - onur: yeah so fairness could be discussed in that space as well
31/07/2025, 22:06 - onur: u know
31/07/2025, 22:06 - onur: or racial stuff
31/07/2025, 22:07 - onur: it is a loaded one
31/07/2025, 22:07 - +44 7516 029853: (off topic)
I am sure it was always a dude in his 60s
https://x.com/lofigirl/status/1950255002163040428
31/07/2025, 22:09 - +44 7562 292419: I guess we all come to the topic with biases
31/07/2025, 22:09 - +44 7562 292419: I mean I don't believe the world is remotely fair
31/07/2025, 22:10 - +44 7562 292419: I got into science thinking it represented the one true objective thing
31/07/2025, 22:10 - +44 7562 292419: But then you realise how biased even science can be
31/07/2025, 22:11 - +44 7562 292419: Nothing is perfect, I guess
31/07/2025, 22:11 - +44 7562 292419: 😅
31/07/2025, 22:11 - +44 7562 292419: Except Australian mangos 🥭
31/07/2025, 22:14 - onur: <Media omitted>
31/07/2025, 22:14 - onur: hahahahahahha
31/07/2025, 22:14 - onur: that came out of nowhere
31/07/2025, 22:16 - +44 7889 480662: Wow that person does not know how to spell the word studier
31/07/2025, 22:16 - onur: it is
31/07/2025, 22:17 - onur: imagine the person who is writing this
31/07/2025, 22:17 - onur: this
31/07/2025, 22:17 - onur: its hilarious
31/07/2025, 22:17 - onur: :DDDD
31/07/2025, 22:17 - onur: what triggered you  this much omg
31/07/2025, 22:23 - +44 7562 292419: What do you see as the most important philosophical question of our time?
31/07/2025, 22:23 - +44 7562 292419: Bam! Philosophy question 😂
31/07/2025, 22:23 - +44 7562 292419: I'm not convinced that the question of consciousness is the most important
31/07/2025, 22:23 - +44 7889 480662: Is the brain truly the only real thing when it comes to the human form and we are just a hallucination of it trying to make sure it doesn't die of absolute boredom
31/07/2025, 22:24 - +44 7562 292419: I actually think the meaning of work and where we derive our value
31/07/2025, 22:24 - +44 7562 292419: Not only cause AI will likely make us unemployed
31/07/2025, 22:25 - +44 7562 292419: But people pretty consistently vote for and allow the worst things for the promise of reduced unemployment
31/07/2025, 22:25 - +44 7889 480662: I think the finest example of this is from this the remake of Willy wonka  and the chocolate factory if an AI device will take our jobs then when that AI device eventually breaks down you can get the job fixing the AI
31/07/2025, 22:25 - +44 7562 292419: And it's what occupies and controls most people's lives
31/07/2025, 22:27 - +44 7562 292419: I wonder if we will see similar changes in human health like we did with the discovery of penicillin
31/07/2025, 22:27 - +44 7562 292419: I could imagine that in our life time
31/07/2025, 22:28 - +44 7889 480662: I mean we already have prosthetic limbs that literally can connect to the synapses of human brain at this point we're getting close to doctor octopus arms from marvel if that's the case
31/07/2025, 22:28 - +44 7562 292419: But it's not readily available, I guess 😅
31/07/2025, 22:28 - +44 7562 292419: It's pretty crazy
31/07/2025, 22:31 - onur: how to deal with meaninglessness
31/07/2025, 22:31 - onur: a persons approach to this question is character defining
31/07/2025, 22:32 - +44 7562 292419: I agree
31/07/2025, 22:32 - +44 7562 292419: I just crumbled when I was unemployed
31/07/2025, 22:32 - +44 7562 292419: Cause I didn't feel like anything mattered
31/07/2025, 22:32 - +44 7562 292419: Not a very healthy or mature response 😅
31/07/2025, 22:32 - onur: there is a free test where you put a bullet in your head and see if you wake up
31/07/2025, 22:32 - +44 7562 292419: But I don't really care about trying to make myself sound better than I am
31/07/2025, 22:33 - onur: have u read marx?
31/07/2025, 22:33 - +44 7889 480662: Damn dude you went to a dark place there I actually love that you made me laugh my fucking head off
31/07/2025, 22:33 - onur: I think he wrote on this
31/07/2025, 22:33 - +44 7562 292419: I read the communist manifesto
31/07/2025, 22:33 - +44 7562 292419: And watched a bunch of videos and history videos
31/07/2025, 22:33 - +44 7889 480662: The Communist manifesto written by one of the biggest dead beats in history
31/07/2025, 22:33 - onur: he wrote on alienation
31/07/2025, 22:33 - +44 7562 292419: Both for and against
31/07/2025, 22:34 - +44 7562 292419: And listened to a podcast breaking down the theories
31/07/2025, 22:34 - onur: I am unemployed rn and I feel u
31/07/2025, 22:34 - +44 7562 292419: I think marx was essentially exactly right with his criticisms
31/07/2025, 22:34 - onur: https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/alienation/
31/07/2025, 22:34 - +44 7562 292419: But the actual idea of communism has obviously been proven to not work as intended
31/07/2025, 22:34 - +44 7562 292419: Maybe it can be modified
31/07/2025, 22:35 - +44 7562 292419: But I don't take anyone seriously who doesn't acknowledge that it essentially failed in the 20th century
31/07/2025, 22:35 - +44 7562 292419: Like scary right about a lot of things 😅
31/07/2025, 22:36 - onur: not the communism
31/07/2025, 22:36 - onur: but this alienation is really intersting
31/07/2025, 22:36 - +44 7889 480662: Yeah he was right about a lot of things too bad his work was so heavily bastardized by one of the greatest leaders of horror which is Joseph Stalin
31/07/2025, 22:36 - onur: and speaks volumes in our day and age
31/07/2025, 22:37 - +44 7562 292419: I just don't think ideologically driven political movements make sense 😅
31/07/2025, 22:37 - +44 7562 292419: Like it feels very ends justify the means
31/07/2025, 22:37 - onur: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38Z4qNNRPZo
31/07/2025, 22:37 - +44 7562 292419: It's like Popper said
31/07/2025, 22:38 - +44 7562 292419: You should try to make the world a utopia as that is poorly defined and endless
31/07/2025, 22:38 - +44 7562 292419: You should try to reduce suffering
31/07/2025, 22:38 - +44 7562 292419: Cause we know what that is. It's real, we all see and understand it, and for the most part we know how we would stop it
31/07/2025, 22:42 - +44 7599 430972: What did you do today to reduce your own’s suffering?
31/07/2025, 22:42 - onur: does weed count? :D
31/07/2025, 22:48 - +44 7599 430972: Yes
31/07/2025, 22:49 - +44 7599 430972: Do you think weed reduces suffering or masks it?
31/07/2025, 22:51 - onur: Well brother
31/07/2025, 22:51 - onur: Suffering and other emotions are not permanent
31/07/2025, 22:52 - onur: So I don’t have a problem with suffering, it is a normal part of our lives
31/07/2025, 22:53 - onur: When it comes to your question it depends according how you frame it :D
31/07/2025, 22:53 - onur: For me I like it because I get bored and nonchalant without weed
31/07/2025, 22:54 - onur: It gives me a laugh :d
31/07/2025, 22:54 - +44 7599 430972: Hmm let’s hypothetically say you’re poor
31/07/2025, 22:54 - +44 7599 430972: Would you say feeling of suffering you get from it is temporary?
31/07/2025, 22:54 - onur: I am poor already and yeah I guess, I mean they come in waves
31/07/2025, 22:54 - onur: :D
31/07/2025, 22:55 - onur: If you mean that there will always be something that youll suffer thus its permanent
31/07/2025, 22:55 - onur: Id agree with that
31/07/2025, 22:55 - +44 7599 430972: I can’t speak for everyone
31/07/2025, 22:56 - onur: So we need to understand the experience and surf in the wave u know :D if you are sad go listen linkin park in the end
31/07/2025, 22:56 - +44 7599 430972: But with money my mental state improved dramatically
31/07/2025, 22:56 - +44 7599 430972: I think our emotions are much more external than we believe
31/07/2025, 22:56 - +44 7599 430972: I think the depression is a function of your environment and not of yourself
31/07/2025, 22:56 - onur: Yeah one would feel equipped to deal whats to come
31/07/2025, 22:58 - +44 7958 612614: should having sex while watching telly be illegal?
31/07/2025, 22:58 - +44 7599 430972: I think you should have telly on but it should play family guy
31/07/2025, 22:59 - +44 7958 612614: are you deliberately avoiding answering the question?
31/07/2025, 23:00 - +44 7958 612614: that's the problem with controversial topics - people too scared to engage
31/07/2025, 23:00 - +44 7599 430972: My answer implies “no”
31/07/2025, 23:01 - +44 7599 430972: I think we are focusing too much on making things illegal
31/07/2025, 23:01 - +44 7599 430972: See where it lead Britain to
31/07/2025, 23:01 - +44 7958 612614: ok, should it be legal then?
31/07/2025, 23:02 - +44 7958 612614: i was trying to come up with something really stupid - but that's a whole art in itself
31/07/2025, 23:02 - +44 7958 612614: clearly, i'm but an artist 🥲
31/07/2025, 23:03 - +44 7599 430972: Which side to the wall should the toilet paper roll be
31/07/2025, 23:24 - onur: U dont need to force, be natural and it will come
31/07/2025, 23:31 - +44 7516 029853: It's not the best example because we know it's legal and always will be. However, I would not only criminalise it, I would even go against my own principles and introduce the death penalty for this crime.
01/08/2025, 07:46 - +44 7562 292419: Morning everyone ☀️
01/08/2025, 08:43 - +44 7958 612614: wow, that's so inspirational!
01/08/2025, 08:45 - +44 7958 612614: wherever you can't easily reach it
01/08/2025, 09:03 - +44 7516 029853: <Media omitted>
01/08/2025, 09:04 - +44 7562 292419: Awwww 🐈
01/08/2025, 09:04 - +44 7562 292419: Now I really want a cat
01/08/2025, 09:05 - +44 7562 292419: And some vegetables 🥒😂
01/08/2025, 09:45 - +44 7599 430972: <Media omitted>

01/08/2025, 09:59 - +44 7562 292419: Was talking about periods stigmatized in your culture? It was in Australia when I grew up, which was frankly ridiculous 😅
01/08/2025, 10:05 - +44 7516 029853: Yeah, absolutely. I still think it's stigmatised, though in the UK it was a bit better.
01/08/2025, 10:06 - +44 7516 029853: Moldova has a very segregated community of Romas, they live separately and speak their own language. They are also incredibly conservative. So, Roma women during menstruation are often prohibited from using some common areas in their households. <This message was edited>
01/08/2025, 10:06 - +44 7562 292419: Australia was one of the first countries to provide sick leave for menstrual cramps
01/08/2025, 10:07 - +44 7562 292419: Which happened because a woman fainted at work cause of the pain
01/08/2025, 10:07 - +44 7562 292419: But how would they know 😅
01/08/2025, 10:08 - +44 7516 029853: They all talk to gods👂🏻
01/08/2025, 10:08 - +44 7562 292419: 😅😂
01/08/2025, 10:10 - +44 7516 029853: One of many reasons why I left orchestra conducting and never wanted to come back. No matter how awful you feel, if there is a rehearsal, you take pills and stand in front of the orchestra conducting for many hours without rest (while the orchestra players can sit).
Not many know how physically taxing conducting is. <This message was edited>
01/08/2025, 10:14 - +44 7562 292419: Oh that sounds terrible
01/08/2025, 10:15 - +44 7562 292419: I'd never do anything professionally that I couldn't do whilst also drinking a coffee 😂
01/08/2025, 10:15 - +44 7562 292419: That's why I left the lab fast
01/08/2025, 10:15 - +44 7516 029853: Chemist?
01/08/2025, 10:15 - +44 7562 292419: Exactly
01/08/2025, 10:16 - +44 7562 292419: I made one molecule in my entire career and that's enough for me 😂
01/08/2025, 10:16 - onur: What pils
01/08/2025, 10:16 - +44 7562 292419: Now I'm a computer nerd
01/08/2025, 10:16 - +44 7516 029853: Is it a good one?
01/08/2025, 10:17 - +44 7516 029853: Mainly Ibuprofen.But it depends how severe it is. Some women struggle with that a lot
01/08/2025, 10:18 - +44 7562 292419: Na 😂 it was a potential drug candidate for Factor Xa inhibition
01/08/2025, 10:19 - +44 7516 029853: It sounds cool, though
01/08/2025, 10:19 - +44 7516 029853: In a sense related to the blood discussion we have, right?
01/08/2025, 10:20 - +44 7562 292419: And I made it during a simple amide bond formation reaction
01/08/2025, 10:21 - +44 7562 292419: Yeah true. Factor Xa is involved in blood coagulation
01/08/2025, 10:22 - +44 7562 292419: Now I just do computational and AI stuff
01/08/2025, 10:22 - +44 7562 292419: The lab is for people better than me 😂
01/08/2025, 10:25 - +44 7562 292419: Chemistry is weird, cause it's so experimental
01/08/2025, 10:26 - +44 7562 292419: You spend a lot of the time in the lab mixing boiling acid with carcinogens 😂
01/08/2025, 10:38 - +44 7958 612614: only ONE??  You’re a failure, Alex 😩
01/08/2025, 10:38 - +44 7562 292419: Exactly 😂😂😂😂😂
01/08/2025, 10:39 - +44 7958 612614: A component in LSD?
01/08/2025, 10:39 - +44 7562 292419: No 😂 I don't do natural product chemistry 🧪
01/08/2025, 10:39 - +44 7562 292419: That's way too hard core
01/08/2025, 10:40 - +44 7958 612614: Do you do fusion chemistry?
01/08/2025, 10:40 - +44 7562 292419: It was a very basic molecule
01/08/2025, 10:40 - +44 7958 612614: lab freestyling
01/08/2025, 10:40 - +44 7562 292419: No
01/08/2025, 10:40 - +44 7958 612614: expressive improv chemistry?
01/08/2025, 10:40 - +44 7562 292419: I was a cheminformatician focusing on drug discovery
01/08/2025, 10:40 - +44 7958 612614: I knew it, psychodelics?
01/08/2025, 10:40 - +44 7562 292419: So algorithmic driven designs for drug molecules
01/08/2025, 10:41 - +44 7562 292419: And I initially designed my algorithm to make the molecules super simple to make 😂
01/08/2025, 10:41 - +44 7562 292419: No ring closures 😂
01/08/2025, 10:41 - +44 7958 612614: Your problem is that you’re too talented...
01/08/2025, 10:41 - +44 7562 292419: 😂
01/08/2025, 10:42 - +44 7958 612614: well, misunderstood 🙂
01/08/2025, 10:42 - +44 7562 292419: The thing is, it takes a decade to even be bad at synthesis
01/08/2025, 10:42 - +44 7958 612614: rubbish, i was born bad
01/08/2025, 10:42 - +44 7562 292419: I did a degree and a PhD in chemistry, but because I didn't focus on synthesis, I'd be laughed out of the lab
01/08/2025, 10:43 - +44 7562 292419: While computational work is way more open and forgiving
01/08/2025, 10:43 - +44 7958 612614: that’s just snobbery.  Ignore them.  Do you thing
01/08/2025, 10:43 - +44 7562 292419: They're willing to let you try and learn
01/08/2025, 10:43 - +44 7562 292419: I also hate the lab fyi
01/08/2025, 10:43 - +44 7562 292419: I'm a computer/maths guy
01/08/2025, 10:43 - +44 7562 292419: I love equations more than chemicals
01/08/2025, 10:44 - +44 7958 612614: <Media omitted>
01/08/2025, 10:44 - +44 7562 292419: But now everything is becoming AI
01/08/2025, 10:44 - +44 7562 292419: 😅
01/08/2025, 10:44 - +44 7958 612614: I’d love to do the lab work as in Rocky Horror Show
01/08/2025, 10:44 - +44 7562 292419: Yes!
01/08/2025, 10:45 - +44 7958 612614: I’m becoming increasingly anti AI…. If only I could use it - it would make sense, but democratising the AI is just not the way
01/08/2025, 10:52 - +44 7516 029853: it's like saying "I hate money"
01/08/2025, 10:53 - +44 7516 029853: AI can help us in many aspects, as well as destroying lives
01/08/2025, 10:53 - +44 7516 029853: But AI is much more interesting as a concept than money <This message was edited>
01/08/2025, 10:53 - +44 7562 292419: I love and fear AI 😅
01/08/2025, 10:53 - +44 7562 292419: That's why I'm trying to learn it professionally
01/08/2025, 10:55 - +44 7516 029853: I think I personally will do well, because I am relatively young, already switched careers and quickly learn, but I am sure that in the hands of uncontrolled capitalism it will damage many things
01/08/2025, 10:55 - +44 7516 029853: things and most importantly lives
01/08/2025, 10:55 - +44 7516 029853: but it will improve lives too <This message was edited>
01/08/2025, 10:56 - +44 7516 029853: I think the scissors effect will be more visible in the future
01/08/2025, 10:58 - +44 7562 292419: Scissors effect?
01/08/2025, 10:58 - +91 80720 44735: Yeah, nice way to put it@
01/08/2025, 10:59 - +91 80720 44735: Scissors helps, but cuts
01/08/2025, 10:59 - +44 7516 029853: poor become poorer, rich richer
01/08/2025, 10:59 - +44 7516 029853: but I think it will be mostly about intellectual and social life
01/08/2025, 10:59 - +44 7562 292419: Ah 😅
01/08/2025, 10:59 - +44 7516 029853: I am sure wealthy countries will have to introduce Basic Universal Income
01/08/2025, 11:00 - +44 7562 292419: I'm just hoping I can keep doing science
01/08/2025, 11:00 - +44 7516 029853: And the privileged once will work on cool projects,not just existing
01/08/2025, 11:00 - +44 7562 292419: I mean I genuinely like Ai as a field
01/08/2025, 11:00 - +44 7562 292419: That's why I did it in my PhD
01/08/2025, 11:00 - +44 7562 292419: But the implications are uncertain
01/08/2025, 11:00 - +91 80720 44735: You could say this about anything, tho
01/08/2025, 11:01 - +91 80720 44735: Robotics? Nukes? Politics? Capitalism?
01/08/2025, 11:01 - +91 80720 44735: I think the main reason we're all so scared of AI right now is that it's coming for White Collar Jobs
01/08/2025, 11:02 - +91 80720 44735: Workers have been organizing and protesting robots for over a century, starting with industrialization and mechanized looms (Luddites, anybody?)
01/08/2025, 11:03 - +44 7516 029853: And without white collar jobs there isn't that much need in other jobs as someone needs to pay for services
01/08/2025, 11:04 - +91 80720 44735: I mean, we can all become electricians and plumbers, but we won't get paid $$$
01/08/2025, 11:04 - +91 80720 44735: Hence the drama
01/08/2025, 11:04 - +91 80720 44735: "You either join the AI bandwagon, or you get razed by it"
01/08/2025, 11:04 - +91 80720 44735: Similar to 'If you can't beat 'em, join 'em'
01/08/2025, 11:05 - +44 7516 029853: And I am sure UBI will be a thing much sooner than we think
01/08/2025, 11:05 - +91 80720 44735: But politically we def need to have that conversation, on where we want AI and where not, or how we are going to handle the changes
01/08/2025, 11:05 - +91 80720 44735: I'm against UBI
01/08/2025, 11:05 - +44 7516 029853: As a concept?
01/08/2025, 11:05 - +91 80720 44735: UBI just means we give a 1000 dollars to everyone, including Bill Gates
01/08/2025, 11:06 - +91 80720 44735: Well, Bill doesn't need those 10 100$ Bills! loll
01/08/2025, 11:06 - +44 7516 029853: Not really, it's more like benefits on steroids
01/08/2025, 11:06 - +44 7516 029853: For a much bigger population than it's usually scaled
01/08/2025, 11:06 - +91 80720 44735: You're saying, 'UBI', but what you're really meaning is a Unemployment Safety Net for everyone
01/08/2025, 11:06 - +91 80720 44735: That's not UBI
01/08/2025, 11:07 - +91 80720 44735: That's just our current Welfare System at a bigger scale
01/08/2025, 11:07 - +91 80720 44735: I'd be down for a massive safety net
01/08/2025, 11:07 - +91 80720 44735: But the problem with safety nets is that they will give you life but not a living
01/08/2025, 11:08 - +91 80720 44735: Who wants to just drink soup and worry if we have the 'budget' for that snickers bar?
01/08/2025, 11:08 - +91 80720 44735: More than 'safety net' which is the most talked about - more critical imho is the re-education part which nobody's talking about
01/08/2025, 11:09 - +44 7516 029853: Starmer talks about it occasionally
01/08/2025, 11:09 - +91 80720 44735: I dunno that anybody thinks that we can have a society where 20% are Billionaires, and they basically 'subsidize' the rest 80% who are all unemployed?
01/08/2025, 11:09 - +91 80720 44735: Not in the same scale
01/08/2025, 11:09 - +91 80720 44735: He's talking a few millions
01/08/2025, 11:09 - +44 7516 029853: And also predominantly about replacing foreign skill workers
01/08/2025, 11:09 - +91 80720 44735: Whereas we need a massive, massive effort, especially $$$
01/08/2025, 11:10 - +91 80720 44735: Which is fine, but then training your own is way more expensive, does he have that budget?
01/08/2025, 11:10 - +91 80720 44735: Not sustainable in the long term, atleast
01/08/2025, 11:12 - +44 7562 292419: My main goal is to get good enough at programming that I can tame the AI and potentially work in it
01/08/2025, 11:12 - +44 7562 292419: 😅
01/08/2025, 11:13 - +91 80720 44735: Almost ALL AI Engineers are simply that, 'AI Tamers'
01/08/2025, 11:13 - +91 80720 44735: We work with a technology we cannot even comprehend fully, let alone understand
01/08/2025, 11:16 - +44 7516 029853: I want to use it to make my life better and to solve problems which I can solve ☺️
01/08/2025, 11:16 - +44 7516 029853: Without selling my soul, hopefully
01/08/2025, 11:17 - +44 7516 029853: I still have principles despite my advanced age 😊
01/08/2025, 11:18 - +44 7958 612614: Right… just wait and see how helpful it will be in the long run…. Just like until very recently people thought that democracy is immune from democratic dictators.
01/08/2025, 11:28 - +44 7562 292419: What do you do
01/08/2025, 11:30 - +44 7958 612614: do you mean - what one does to improve the situation?
01/08/2025, 11:31 - onur: For starmer refugees>skilled workers xD
01/08/2025, 11:41 - +44 7599 430972: Which is crazy as refugees cannot legally work

01/08/2025, 11:50 - Parag-meetup: Just more difficult to do and less well paid

01/08/2025, 14:42 - +44 7562 292419: Do you own a cat?
01/08/2025, 14:44 - +44 7516 029853: Not yet, but I grew up with many cats and have rescued stray ones.
01/08/2025, 14:44 - +44 7516 029853: Was woke before it was trendy✨
01/08/2025, 14:49 - +44 7516 029853: Once, I even found a newborn kitten in the rubbish bin! People can be so unreasonably cruel, why are many expecting AI to have a perfect "moral compass" idk
01/08/2025, 14:51 - +44 7562 292419: You definitely need a cat/kitten 😄😺😺

01/08/2025, 14:57 - +44 7562 292419: Always take it as a compliment 😂
01/08/2025, 15:02 - +44 7562 292419: Even if in the UK it's almost always an insult 😂

01/08/2025, 18:17 - +91 80720 44735: Based on what I could understand, two issues - one 'real', another imagined - 
1. College football stars are being traded for millions, but because they are student athletes, they don't make any money, all the Billions of dollars is made by the Association and Colleges... 
2. Men in Women's sports - the Transgender red herring / made up issue
01/08/2025, 19:35 - Parag-meetup: Didn’t do any homework 
Was winging it as always , and his  demented self shines
01/08/2025, 19:35 - Parag-meetup: When Boris did it with peppa big , every one made big hoo haa about it , trump has made it commonplace
01/08/2025, 19:39 - Parag-meetup: I will end every war in 24 hours 
I am the best at it !

01/08/2025, 19:40 - +44 7562 292419: Hey thanks everyone for getting me through a somewhat stressful week 😃

01/08/2025, 22:34 - +44 7562 292419: Is there any philosophical merit in a belief of life after death?
01/08/2025, 22:34 - +44 7889 480662: I mean yes I would say that there's many philosophical merits to it one specifically is that if people believe they would be nothing after they go they may become nihilistic and may lose hope that there is anything for them to look forward to after all the misery of earth
01/08/2025, 22:35 - +44 7599 430972: Yeah mostly trying to define what life is
01/08/2025, 22:35 - +44 7599 430972: There is an argument to be made that no one is “alive”
01/08/2025, 22:35 - +44 7889 480662: That is a very interesting way of looking at it I must submit Alex
01/08/2025, 22:35 - +44 7599 430972: or that “being alive” only exists because we die
01/08/2025, 22:36 - +44 7889 480662: One of my favourite songs we earned the right to live to under right to live to earn the right to die so it basically dares bring up that philosophical conundrum
01/08/2025, 22:36 - +44 7889 480662: Earn the right
01/08/2025, 22:36 - +44 7562 292419: Yeah, I guess the scientific definitions of life don't feel like they encapsulate the experience
01/08/2025, 22:36 - +44 7562 292419: Like how viruses are technically alive cause they can't reproduce on their own
01/08/2025, 22:37 - +44 7562 292419: Aren't*
01/08/2025, 22:37 - +44 7889 480662: I mean you could say that about a lot of microscopic organisms though couldn't you
01/08/2025, 22:37 - +44 7562 292419: But does anyone here actually believe in life after death?
01/08/2025, 22:37 - +44 7562 292419: Or is it just a useful fiction
01/08/2025, 22:38 - +44 7889 480662: I believe in Valhalla and helheim
01/08/2025, 22:38 - +44 7562 292419: I don't btw 😅
01/08/2025, 22:38 - onur: There is a game called valheim
01/08/2025, 22:38 - onur: XD
01/08/2025, 22:38 - +44 7889 480662: I mean that's completely okay I don't expect everyone to believe in life after death I mean we do have no true evidence of it because we have no way to kill someone and bring them back before there are parents soul leaves the body
01/08/2025, 22:41 - +44 7562 292419: I'm trying to think of other stances like that, where people legitimately believe that it's true, and to me I believe it's completely wrong
01/08/2025, 22:41 - onur: Supernatural?
01/08/2025, 22:41 - onur: :D
01/08/2025, 22:41 - +44 7562 292419: I mean there are opinions of quality. Like "I believe X is good"
01/08/2025, 22:41 - +44 7889 480662: I mean if you believe something is completely false then of course it's hard to get your head around people that believe in something you adamantly do not that's the limits of someone's open-mindedness
01/08/2025, 22:43 - +44 7562 292419: I like the argument in Bayesian epistemology that you can't ever believe anything with 100% or 0% certainty because that would require an infinite amount of evidence
01/08/2025, 22:43 - +44 7889 480662: I think I believe in the way of I believe it when I see it so I can't really say if I will go anywhere in the afterlife until I see it for myself
01/08/2025, 22:45 - +44 7562 292419: I remember thinking about the problem of theodicy. Like why does evil exist
01/08/2025, 22:46 - +44 7562 292419: To me it's obvious. The more interesting question is why does good exist 😅
01/08/2025, 22:46 - +44 7562 292419: And can you actually be good and selfless
01/08/2025, 22:46 - +44 7562 292419: Or is everything just different layers of self-interest
01/08/2025, 22:48 - +44 7599 430972: I think when people use logic predicates to evaluate statements they need to be aware of the basis of their algebra
01/08/2025, 22:48 - +44 7599 430972: The statement “everything done is done in self-interest” internally always true and cannot be disproven
01/08/2025, 22:48 - +44 7599 430972: Therefore does not pass Popper criteria
01/08/2025, 22:49 - +44 7599 430972: Equally in life after death or god that creates stones they cannot lift
01/08/2025, 22:55 - +44 7516 029853: What's the answer?
01/08/2025, 22:56 - +44 7562 292419: Cause people are selfish
01/08/2025, 22:56 - +44 7889 480662: I mean selfless is harder to say than being good if you ask me because I some people believe there was no such thing as a selfless good deed
01/08/2025, 22:56 - +44 7562 292419: And exploring others benefits you 😅
01/08/2025, 22:56 - +44 7562 292419: Exploiting*
01/08/2025, 22:57 - +44 7516 029853: We can exploit each other in a collaborative (healthy competition etc) way, but for some reason even biologically some people are born with sociopathy and sadistic tendencies
01/08/2025, 22:58 - +44 7562 292419: You just hear of crazy things, like when Chernobyl exploded a lot of the scientists were sent home but came back to try and help
01/08/2025, 22:58 - +44 7889 480662: I mean I've watched enough true crime to understand that some people believe that evil can be in nature not only nurture because some serial killers are actually evil from birth they're not influenced by abuse trauma depravity
01/08/2025, 22:58 - +44 7562 292419: Yeah, mutual exploitation makes sense to me. But we always seem to take it too far
01/08/2025, 22:59 - +44 7599 430972: Is anyone of you scared of love?
01/08/2025, 22:59 - +44 7889 480662: Not exactly scared of love scared of trusting
01/08/2025, 22:59 - +44 7516 029853: That's what I am talking about. It's somehow inevitable, however, it can be increased and it does
01/08/2025, 23:00 - +44 7562 292419: Yeah 😅 I guess there's a fear of your love for someone else diminishing your value or autonomy as a person
01/08/2025, 23:00 - +44 7516 029853: So why? Is it biology or something else? Biology definitely plays a part in it.
01/08/2025, 23:00 - +44 7889 480662: You see I'm not afraid of that to be fair because everything is temporary if you think about it that means lob can diminish and you shouldn't be afraid of things that may be inevitable
01/08/2025, 23:00 - +44 7599 430972: I get this sometimes that when I get too serious with someone my feelings just switch off
01/08/2025, 23:01 - +44 7599 430972: It’s so shitty because it’s not like you feel completely nothing, you just feel sad and sorry and embarrassed and angry
01/08/2025, 23:02 - +44 7889 480662: I just feel like I wasted my time and with how limited our time on this realm is wasting time is ridiculous
01/08/2025, 23:02 - +44 7516 029853: I used to be much more scared but now I work on convincing myself that I am brave enough to love 🥲
01/08/2025, 23:02 - +44 7562 292419: There's an idea that we are naturally violent because the people early humans were more likely to be killed 😅
01/08/2025, 23:03 - +44 7889 480662: Yes but do you believe that to be able to love someone else you need to love yourself at least somewhat?
01/08/2025, 23:03 - +44 7562 292419: Also that you're deserving of love and respect
01/08/2025, 23:03 - +44 7562 292419: A lot of people "love you" in the sense that they want to dominate and control
01/08/2025, 23:03 - +44 7562 292419: Love without respect is meaningless
01/08/2025, 23:03 - +44 7889 480662: That's why I find boundaries to be most imperative in relationships
01/08/2025, 23:05 - +44 7516 029853: So evil exists because we are violent by nature? Why do we need extremes, though?
01/08/2025, 23:06 - +44 7889 480662: I mean I honestly believe that evil is something that is brought into the world it is molded it is formed by the ones around the person that committed the evil act
01/08/2025, 23:07 - +44 7516 029853: That has a clear logic, but there is no god for me, so the answer isn't working for me
01/08/2025, 23:08 - +44 7889 480662: Are you saying that to me or are you saying that to someone else just wondering
01/08/2025, 23:08 - +44 7516 029853: no god, nothing was brought into the world.
unless it was an angry planet but it's not alive
01/08/2025, 23:08 - +44 7516 029853: you
01/08/2025, 23:08 - +44 7889 480662: But the planet is a living organism we already know that
01/08/2025, 23:08 - onur: Which planet is that
01/08/2025, 23:09 - +44 7562 292419: It seems life is naturally exploitative. We literally can't live without consuming other living organisms
01/08/2025, 23:09 - +44 7889 480662: The planet earth the one be reside on
01/08/2025, 23:09 - +44 7516 029853: Planet of love and respect ❤️
01/08/2025, 23:09 - +44 7599 430972: Your mom
01/08/2025, 23:09 - +44 7562 292419: I guess for me, evil is when we direct that exploitive nature at other humans
01/08/2025, 23:09 - onur: It is a biosphere it is not a living organism
01/08/2025, 23:10 - +44 7889 480662: Will I disagree with that myself because some of the main things living organisms do is grow and adapt and one of the main things the earth is known for is growing an adapting
01/08/2025, 23:10 - +44 7562 292419: But like I need something to die in order to eat 😅
01/08/2025, 23:11 - +44 7562 292419: Either an animal or a plant
01/08/2025, 23:11 - +44 7889 480662: This makes you sound like Galactus from the marvel comic series 😂
01/08/2025, 23:11 - +44 7562 292419: And we were all born accepting to some degree that one species should dominate an entire planet
01/08/2025, 23:11 - +44 7562 292419: Which is obviously unfair and harmfuln
01/08/2025, 23:12 - +44 7516 029853: All born sinful, Augustine of Hippo was right, yes
01/08/2025, 23:12 - onur: A living organism is a single, self-contained entity that:
	•	Has a boundary (like skin or a cell wall),
	•	Maintains internal balance (homeostasis),
	•	Grows, reproduces, and responds to stimuli,
	•	Is made of cells.
01/08/2025, 23:13 - +44 7889 480662: I mean growing reproducing and responding to stimuli why do you think the world is damaging itself how it is it's resolving to the stimuli of what we're committing to it not to mention it grows all of its natural resources even before humans were able to plant themselves
01/08/2025, 23:13 - onur: You are narrativising earths movements into these maybe
01/08/2025, 23:14 - onur: U understand its a rock
01/08/2025, 23:14 - onur: Right?
01/08/2025, 23:14 - +44 7889 480662: It's not only a rock there's much more to the planet earth than just rock
01/08/2025, 23:14 - +44 7516 029853: But is it? Did we create that set of rules? We need to destroy it in order to survive. We can, potentially, all die, but people say it's not that easy as our biology is wired to keep us alive
01/08/2025, 23:14 - onur: Yeah rock related stuff like magma and craters
01/08/2025, 23:15 - onur: And there are ponds in it
01/08/2025, 23:15 - +44 7889 480662: What about water what about nature what about natural forming ice why are you only talking about The rock
01/08/2025, 23:15 - +44 7562 292419: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panpsychism
01/08/2025, 23:15 - onur: The rock is the earth
01/08/2025, 23:15 - onur: The others you mentioned are living organisms living on that rock
01/08/2025, 23:15 - +44 7562 292419: There's the idea of pan-psychism that we should extend the definition of consciousness to all things
01/08/2025, 23:15 - onur: Because its warm and humid
01/08/2025, 23:15 - +44 7562 292419: Including rocks
01/08/2025, 23:16 - onur: If u want to entertain yourselves with that thought be my guest

01/08/2025, 23:18 - +44 7516 029853: That's actually a person I saw IRL
01/08/2025, 23:19 - onur: No its a hummingbird <This message was edited>
01/08/2025, 23:19 - +44 7889 480662: No I meant how she was trying to sell her mini snooker set
01/08/2025, 23:19 - +44 7516 029853: lol, missed it
01/08/2025, 23:19 - +44 7889 480662: Yeah she basically posted a mini snooker set and then deleted all of the pictures and the link
01/08/2025, 23:20 - onur: that is what you would expect from a hummingbird
01/08/2025, 23:20 - onur: A mini snooker set
01/08/2025, 23:21 - +44 7562 292419: I'm lost
01/08/2025, 23:21 - +44 7516 029853: Who isn't?
01/08/2025, 23:22 - +44 7562 292419: I just want to feel connected to others
01/08/2025, 23:22 - +44 7562 292419: I think a drive for community is strong in humans
01/08/2025, 23:22 - +44 7516 029853: Are you a hippie?  😂
01/08/2025, 23:22 - +44 7562 292419: I try to be 😂
01/08/2025, 23:23 - +44 7562 292419: I do have long hair
01/08/2025, 23:23 - +44 7516 029853: I think it's wired and much more important than it seems to be
01/08/2025, 23:23 - +44 7562 292419: What do you mean?
01/08/2025, 23:25 - onur: Yeah who cares what you did unless you get to explain
01/08/2025, 23:25 - +44 7516 029853: Since the Industrial Revolution people have become much less interconnected and more independent to a fault. It has become quite radical and led to multiple crises
01/08/2025, 23:25 - +44 7562 292419: I agree
01/08/2025, 23:26 - +44 7562 292419: Since leaving Australia I experienced what it is to be truly alone
01/08/2025, 23:26 - +44 7562 292419: Not great 😅
01/08/2025, 23:27 - onur: Try losing ur job
01/08/2025, 23:27 - +44 7562 292419: I did
01/08/2025, 23:27 - onur: A whole new eye opening experience
01/08/2025, 23:27 - onur: XD
01/08/2025, 23:27 - +44 7562 292419: I was unemployed for 2 years
01/08/2025, 23:27 - +44 7562 292419: With 1000 left in the bank
01/08/2025, 23:28 - +44 7562 292419: In a country where I didn't know anyone
01/08/2025, 23:28 - onur: I am in the same situation now
01/08/2025, 23:28 - onur: With less in the bank
01/08/2025, 23:28 - onur: XD
01/08/2025, 23:28 - +44 7562 292419: I thought my life was over, honestly
01/08/2025, 23:28 - +44 7562 292419: Then I got my dream job
01/08/2025, 23:28 - onur: Broo
01/08/2025, 23:29 - +44 7562 292419: And in hindsight it wasn't as bad as I thought and I really wasted that time
01/08/2025, 23:30 - onur: I just got rejected again for the final round today
01/08/2025, 23:30 - onur: I had the presentation on Monday
01/08/2025, 23:30 - +44 7562 292419: I did 3 months of interviews for one job
01/08/2025, 23:30 - onur: Really struggling here

01/08/2025, 23:30 - onur: :D
01/08/2025, 23:30 - +44 7562 292419: Rejected at the last stage
01/08/2025, 23:30 - +44 7562 292419: Similar 😅
01/08/2025, 23:31 - onur: So you are saying that it can take 2 years
01/08/2025, 23:31 - onur: 🥸
01/08/2025, 23:32 - +44 7562 292419: It can if you let the lack of motivation and depression take over
01/08/2025, 23:32 - +44 7562 292419: Honestly, in hindsight, if I committed to it I could have had something in 3 months
01/08/2025, 23:33 - onur: Im commited but no luck this fucking sponsorship doesnt help
01/08/2025, 23:34 - onur: It is really soul crushing to get ready for something new each time, build up and result into nothing
01/08/2025, 23:34 - +44 7562 292419: I absolutely understand
01/08/2025, 23:34 - +44 7562 292419: I felt worthless
01/08/2025, 23:34 - +44 7562 292419: But you gotta realize it's just a game
01/08/2025, 23:34 - onur: If its a game im being spawn camped bro
01/08/2025, 23:34 - onur: :D

01/08/2025, 23:36 - onur: Appreciated man thanks

01/08/2025, 23:37 - +44 7562 292419: It's not very impressive, but I completely collapsed
01/08/2025, 23:37 - onur: Yeah thats what I am trying to do otherwise its impossible

01/08/2025, 23:39 - +44 7562 292419: It's tough honestly
01/08/2025, 23:40 - +44 7562 292419: Cause our culture tells you that all your value comes from work
01/08/2025, 23:40 - onur: Its kind of true though
01/08/2025, 23:41 - +44 7516 029853: And because we tend to live in silos it's easily reinforced

02/08/2025, 12:04 - +44 7958 612614: but what does it mean “life” after death?  Is “life” all there is to experience and being?
02/08/2025, 12:06 - +44 7958 612614: concerns that death leads to some “limitations” of being make little sense (to me)
02/08/2025, 12:07 - +44 7958 612614: clearly - where we all come from is what we now call “death”
02/08/2025, 12:35 - +44 7562 292419: How's everyone's weekend looking?
02/08/2025, 12:51 - Will-hazzer777: Looking good... Off to get a burger...
02/08/2025, 15:01 - +44 7562 292419: There's that argument that you don't look at the period before you were alive as being dead
02/08/2025, 15:01 - +44 7562 292419: So why do you look at the future state with more fear and sadness
02/08/2025, 15:01 - +44 7958 612614: lol, why then look at the period after you’ve lived?
02/08/2025, 15:02 - +44 7562 292419: Exactly
02/08/2025, 15:02 - +44 7562 292419: I think that's the argument

Hang in there.. 👍🏼🤞🏼
02/08/2025, 19:22 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: I'm guessing primarily for the one making the case for it? 😉

02/08/2025, 20:22 - +44 7562 292419: Does anyone think that their country of origin gives them a unique philosophical perspective?
02/08/2025, 22:14 - +44 7516 029853: An interesting question indeed!
I will reply later as I am exhausted.
Meanwhile, I was moving to a new place and had a quest. Want to share this masterpiece with everyone in this chat

02/08/2025, 23:03 - +44 7516 029853: So, yes, I think it does, as growing up, we continuously and unconsciously inherit stories and morals of the places we grow up in. 
Time also matters, as it gives a different snippet of the same country. I often tell people that being born after the collapse of the USSR and actually living under the communist regime is a huge difference, even if the young person sympathises with the old regime.
02/08/2025, 23:05 - +44 7516 029853: Similarly, there are patterns, values and moral expectations in each country, which make a nation-nation. People do tend to represent many of them (unless there was another layer of a national/cultural identity), which doesn't mean we should immediately pit people in "boxes", just to be clear.

03/08/2025, 08:31 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: If the country (or region) is in ways successful/influential,  then i suppose yes.... 
Take for example someone from an oil rich muslim country ... or someone from a liberal Norway... or orderly Japanese. 

If the country/culture is in a position of presenting itself as a "success story", then they might link it to their unique philosophy
03/08/2025, 09:17 - Parag-meetup: Really interesting take

05/08/2025, 13:14 - +44 7516 029853: I do not know, tbh. I quit smoking when I moved to the US  - it was just too expensive, and I was a chain smoker before I moved, so I went cold turkey. Then I moved to the UK and discovered vaping, which is really cheap if you buy rechargeable ones. But at some point, I started to question how healthy it is. My inner logic spotted some serious concerns, so I quit. But even 2 months later, I still feel addicted to vapes, I just control it. With regular cigarettes, it was much easier.
05/08/2025, 13:19 - onur: Real men smokes tobacco and cigarettes ✍️
05/08/2025, 13:20 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: The substance that's addictive is the nicotine. 

Vap is a bit healthier because you do not inhale all the toxins that exist in cigarette (the tobacco the other things) whereas vape gives a pure nicotine shot and you only inhale the vapors

How long in the US did you not smoke cigarettes?
05/08/2025, 13:21 - 🔆 Shin-Shane-Shine: Yes...i dad was a real man... and died of lung cancer. 👍🏼

05/08/2025, 22:17 - Will-hazzer777: How you doing @⁨Ali⁩?
05/08/2025, 22:18 - Will-hazzer777: Only in some parts of the world. Time is relative...
05/08/2025, 22:18 - Ali: Is it actually fun and puns in here?
05/08/2025, 22:18 - Will-hazzer777: Most of the time...
05/08/2025, 22:19 - Will-hazzer777: I tend to lower the tone with my morbid humour...
05/08/2025, 22:20 - Ali: No… that doesn’t sound like you, Will! What have you done with Will?
05/08/2025, 22:20 - Ali: Have you covered beastiality, incest, cannibalism and piglophelia yet?
05/08/2025, 22:21 - Will-hazzer777: Oooo I don't know of piglophilelia!
05/08/2025, 22:21 - +353 89 605 0161: Oh yeah.

05/08/2025, 22:21 - Ali: Course ya do… ye olde Cheshire cheese 2021, Michael, Roger and I?
05/08/2025, 22:22 - Ali: I think Michael and I both called Roger a piglophile at the same time and completely out of the blue, we just invented a new word.
05/08/2025, 22:23 - Will-hazzer777: Incest was last mentioned by @⁨~Alex⁩ on 15/02/24
05/08/2025, 22:23 - Ali: Bloody hell.. how do you remember this?
05/08/2025, 22:24 - onur: He searched for the word? 😅
05/08/2025, 22:24 - Will-hazzer777: Similarly... Cannibalism 17/09/24
05/08/2025, 22:25 - Ali: Oh yer
05/08/2025, 22:25 - Ali: Duhhhhh
05/08/2025, 22:25 - Will-hazzer777: Ohh is that touching up pigs inappropriately...
05/08/2025, 22:25 - Ali: Something like that
05/08/2025, 22:25 - Ali: Can’t remember exactly
05/08/2025, 22:26 - Will-hazzer777: All I know is that their sexual organs are curly like their tails.
05/08/2025, 22:26 - Ali: How do you know that then Will? Have you tried?
05/08/2025, 22:27 - Will-hazzer777: Hahaha, I think I found a bit in a bag of pork scratchings once... It had a clump of hair on it too.
05/08/2025, 22:27 - +353 89 605 0161: How'd it taste?
05/08/2025, 22:28 - Will-hazzer777: Salty
05/08/2025, 22:28 - Will-hazzer777: And fatty
05/08/2025, 22:28 - Ali: Was it hard on the outside and soft and wet in the middle?
05/08/2025, 22:28 - Ali: It’s probably a Jane’s toe nail or tail tbh
05/08/2025, 22:29 - Will-hazzer777: Like a Ferrero Roche
05/08/2025, 22:29 - Ali: With extra nuts
05/08/2025, 22:29 - Will-hazzer777: Soggy nuts...
05/08/2025, 22:29 - Will-hazzer777: Jane who makes the scratchings?
05/08/2025, 22:29 - Ali: <Media omitted>
05/08/2025, 22:30 - Ali: Yeah… that’s right
05/08/2025, 22:30 - Will-hazzer777: If only! That'd be my dream!
05/08/2025, 22:30 - Ali: Slamming your balls on the floor?
05/08/2025, 22:31 - Will-hazzer777: That's how id like to get my milk out of a coconut... I'm on the coconut milk these days.
05/08/2025, 22:32 - +353 89 605 0161: You should dream bigger 🤣
05/08/2025, 22:32 - Will-hazzer777: I'm sure mine would have a bit more bounce to them.
05/08/2025, 22:32 - Ali: Oh nice. High in Vitamin C and electrolytes.
05/08/2025, 22:32 - Will-hazzer777: Is it? I had no idea!
05/08/2025, 22:33 - Will-hazzer777: Dream bigger! Bigger coconuts!

05/08/2025, 22:36 - Ali: Crikey….
05/08/2025, 22:37 - Will-hazzer777: Well that's what happens when you bounce balls in the house in an uncontrollable manner.
05/08/2025, 22:39 - Ali: I don’t really know what to say about this other than maybe see a doctor? Or a stonemason or iron monger?
05/08/2025, 22:39 - Will-hazzer777: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=nf670orHKcA

05/08/2025, 22:40 - Ali: Banging song that btw
05/08/2025, 22:41 - Will-hazzer777: The only solution to the situation is to bounce your balls outside, then they can't do any damage... That's what I do.
05/08/2025, 22:41 - Ali: Or YouTube

05/08/2025, 22:42 - Will-hazzer777: To relieve your belly ache... Put a line in your coconut 🥥
05/08/2025, 22:42 - Ali: I think you need a padded cell dahlin
05/08/2025, 22:43 - onur: That sounded nice, for some reason I recalled tom & jerry
05/08/2025, 22:43 - onur: :D

05/08/2025, 22:53 - onur: Thats one of my fav skits
05/08/2025, 22:53 - onur: :d
05/08/2025, 22:54 - Will-hazzer777: I'm sure it can be dragged out for a whole week...

05/08/2025, 22:55 - onur: I stopped trying to understand her 2 years ago
05/08/2025, 22:55 - Will-hazzer777: @⁨Ali⁩ will always have the allure of mystery...
05/08/2025, 22:55 - Ali: It’s 3 chips I had left on my plate in spoons one day. And I needed to just create a sticker to improve an ok and make it feel more wholesome, so I made it.
05/08/2025, 22:56 - Ali: I think it’s just called deranged?
05/08/2025, 22:56 - Will-hazzer777: But it just says K not Ok
05/08/2025, 22:56 - Ali: Zackly… 💁🏻‍♀️
05/08/2025, 22:57 - Will-hazzer777: It's not for you to judge... An artist can never understand themselves or their work... Plato said so...
05/08/2025, 22:57 - Ali: Explains a lot
05/08/2025, 22:59 - Ali: I wrote a song about plato today

You saw me in the dark”

05/08/2025, 23:08 - onur: Bro I was keeping ur identity a secret
05/08/2025, 23:08 - Ali: Is that what it just told you to say?
05/08/2025, 23:12 - Will-hazzer777: There are quite a few alexes in the chat...
05/08/2025, 23:14 - Will-hazzer777: @⁨~Alex⁩ @⁨~Alex⁩ @⁨~Alex⁩ @⁨~Alex⁩ @⁨~Alex S⁩
05/08/2025, 23:14 - Ali: Are all of them active or no?
05/08/2025, 23:14 - Will-hazzer777: I get confused about them because they all have the same name...
05/08/2025, 23:15 - Ali: I guess they will be now… well.. they’ll just quickly check why theyre being talked about.
05/08/2025, 23:15 - Ali: Then go back to sleep
05/08/2025, 23:15 - Ali: This is why nicknames and abusive names help.
05/08/2025, 23:16 - Will-hazzer777: I'm hoping everyone in our chats have got them on mute... If not, their bad...
05/08/2025, 23:16 - Ali: Their problem
05/08/2025, 23:16 - Will-hazzer777: What's @⁨onur⁩ 's abuse name?

06/08/2025, 09:04 - +44 7958 612614: not understanding something is a lack of capacity.  You need to learn how to relate or make sense of other people’s perspectives - I mean, it’s a useful skill...
06/08/2025, 09:54 - Will-hazzer777: I understand it in a logical capacity i.e a logical ability to understand illogical emotion from a logical perspective. However I don't have the capacity to understand it from a direct illogical emotional capacity... In that respect my understanding is limited... 

Just like I don't understand what it's like to see the world like a bat. <This message was edited>

09/08/2025, 11:06 - +44 7958 612614: Scorpions are not only disliked because of perceived danger - there’s something about their appearance and movements that makes people go - YUCK
09/08/2025, 11:43 - +44 7516 029853: I hope you never say it out loud in front of a scorpion. What if it understands you and feels heartbroken?
09/08/2025, 11:45 - +44 7516 029853: Jokes aside, they are scary and maybe why they're a bit yuck. But pseudoscorpions aren't.

11/08/2025, 12:36 - onur: They are a good gift, the person who receives the gift needs to do some research and needs to take care of the plant

11/08/2025, 12:39 - +44 7516 029853: On that note, here's a wholesome story.

My friend gave her significant other a flower bouquet for his birthday. She read that men are likely to get flowers only at their funerals, which is incredibly sad. So we went to a boutique to pick a bouquet for him. We had to build it from scratch as 99% of bouquets are tailored to a specific category of women. 

It was an interesting experience and he was definitely glad to get such a thoughtful gift.
11/08/2025, 12:39 - +44 7516 029853: + to trypophobia, though it's not as strong as it used to be
11/08/2025, 12:40 - onur: I am thinking that these fuckers are selling our numbers to these scammers or there is a leak

Ever since I started to seek for a job, I started to receive a high number of scam calls
11/08/2025, 12:41 - onur: Men wouldnt want to receive a bouquet
11/08/2025, 12:41 - onur: Maybe gay men :D
11/08/2025, 12:41 - Ali: That’s not true
11/08/2025, 12:41 - +44 7516 029853: TESTOSTERONE ALERT!!!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥
11/08/2025, 12:42 - onur: There is no use for a bouquet, it is a waste of resources.

A pot or a plant would be a better gift
11/08/2025, 12:42 - onur: More permanent ;D
11/08/2025, 12:42 - Ali: Potentially yes. Or just a Venus fly trap..
11/08/2025, 12:42 - +44 7516 029853: Oh, love them!
11/08/2025, 12:42 - +353 89 605 0161: If I received a bouquet of flowers I'd assume they're about to murder me
11/08/2025, 12:43 - Ali: I’ll just cancel the order…

11/08/2025, 12:44 - +44 7958 612614: is SO for special other?  is it not rude to call people SPECIAL?
11/08/2025, 12:45 - Ali: Not if the hat fits
11/08/2025, 12:45 - +44 7516 029853: significant
11/08/2025, 12:45 - +353 89 605 0161: It's even less flattering than that.
They are merely significant.
11/08/2025, 12:45 - onur: I would tell my SO, I would much prefer plants that I can take care of which isnt killed for my aesthetic pleasure :D

11/08/2025, 12:47 - +44 7516 029853: I kill plants, so no plants for me.
One of my ex-boyfriends bought a beautiful tiny Venus trap. I liked it very much, so he gave it to me. But I have ADHD, and I got too excited about the plant and killed it 😭
11/08/2025, 12:48 - Ali: Spethal

11/08/2025, 12:56 - +44 7958 612614: why do they keep them under heat producing lights then?
11/08/2025, 12:57 - Ali: 😂
11/08/2025, 12:57 - onur: Well because they are not trying to imitate the original conditions but to maximize the yield in a short amount of time?

11/08/2025, 12:58 - onur: All indoor plants need heat and some kind of a sunlight

11/08/2025, 16:23 - Will-hazzer777: Or putting a wollen jumper in the tumble dryer....
11/08/2025, 16:24 - Ali: I dunno though… if you add salt to them they will shrink through osmosis. <This message was edited>
11/08/2025, 16:24 - Ali: But not by a lot
11/08/2025, 16:25 - Will-hazzer777: That's a possibility but you don't get gherkins by salting cucumbers...
11/08/2025, 16:25 - Ali: Yesssss they’re the best
11/08/2025, 16:25 - +353 89 605 0161: That was the last thing I added to the list!

I've learnt more in the last 10 minutes than the last two years on this chat! <This message was edited>
11/08/2025, 16:26 - Ali: Gherkins are a type of variety of cucumbers
11/08/2025, 16:27 - Will-hazzer777: Are you more delighted by things that shrink when treated or things that expand with treatment?
11/08/2025, 16:27 - Ali: Is this a sexual preference question?
11/08/2025, 16:28 - onur: we try not to sexualize Will
11/08/2025, 16:28 - Will-hazzer777: It's a general question about things that contract or expand...
11/08/2025, 16:28 - +44 7516 029853: Controlling men were so silly and unimaginative that they thought it it just about the long radishes, cucumbers. Even I know that is not how lesbian women interact in a passionate affair 🫠
11/08/2025, 16:28 - +353 89 605 0161: He's pretty young

11/08/2025, 16:28 - Will-hazzer777: ?
11/08/2025, 16:28 - onur: it was a community reference I think Alex got it haha
11/08/2025, 16:31 - Will-hazzer777: I think you're mixing up the two things... They wanted their women to have no sexual interaction... So they were extra lusty when they got to see the Caliph's gherkin...

11/08/2025, 16:33 - +44 7516 029853: In short, lesbians are more likely to be satisfied, so no matter how much they would be controlled, if they lived together, they would find ways to be happy while being forced to wait for the Caliph
11/08/2025, 16:34 - Will-hazzer777: "The percentage of the LW who reported having sexual intercourse at least once a week was significantly lower than that of the HSW"

Does this mean that LW have sex less frequently than HSW?
11/08/2025, 16:35 - +44 7516 029853: I think so, but maybe it is much better
11/08/2025, 16:35 - +44 7516 029853: as it results in a higher satisfaction rate
11/08/2025, 16:35 - Will-hazzer777: But the Caliph thinks it's more difficult to be satisfied when there are no whole radishes or cucumbers around and when the lights are kept on all night...
11/08/2025, 16:35 - onur: I think the bias here is
11/08/2025, 16:36 - onur: a lesbian person would be much more aware of herself and their sexuality compared to a regular heterosexual couple
11/08/2025, 16:36 - Will-hazzer777: So less sex means higher sexual satisfaction when sex is had?
11/08/2025, 16:36 - +44 7958 612614: definitely, and more corruption and cancer 🥳
11/08/2025, 16:37 - +44 7516 029853: Yeah, because the Caliph is, frankly, stupid. 
Forced intercourse is, by default, an unsatisfactory one as it uses power and control instead of sexuality/intimacy as its primary mechanism. But they predominantly needed babies, so....
11/08/2025, 16:38 - onur: it is a known fact most of the hetero relationships especially in 3rd world countries people don't know how to have sex, never reached orgasm or there is statutory rape etc...
11/08/2025, 16:38 - +44 7516 029853: facts

11/08/2025, 16:40 - +44 7958 612614: on the grapevine? the best source of info
11/08/2025, 16:40 - +44 7958 612614: pattern recognition and "stuff"
11/08/2025, 16:41 - +44 7516 029853: Also true. But I guess because lesbians are more likely to communicate their needs, as they are not bounded by the same societal expectations and norms, they are more likely to know how to please each other
11/08/2025, 16:41 - onur: What I mean is it doesnt show that the culture is sexual or there is wisdom in it
11/08/2025, 16:41 - onur: I learned a term called “pillow princess” specific for lesbian relationships xD
11/08/2025, 16:41 - Will-hazzer777: https://cne.news/article/1681-norwegian-research-lesbian-marriages-most-unstable
11/08/2025, 16:41 - +44 7958 612614: honestly, before the western world came into being - life wasn't worth living.  before hollywood - cultural dark age
11/08/2025, 16:42 - Ali: Still isn’t worth living tbh…
11/08/2025, 16:42 - +44 7958 612614: like "stable" is a quality?  they made euro fighter explicitly to be unstable
11/08/2025, 16:43 - +44 7958 612614: there's always a cucumber when the things get really bad
11/08/2025, 16:43 - Will-hazzer777: "Lesbian Bed Death is, simply put, the idea that lesbian couples have less sex."

11/08/2025, 16:44 - Ali: Absolutely. Silver linins n all dat
11/08/2025, 16:44 - +44 7516 029853: I wake up every morning and think:
Thank you, the Universe, for being born relatively late and allowing me to live in relatively modern countries ✨
11/08/2025, 16:44 - Will-hazzer777: Not if the Caliph has anything to do with it...
11/08/2025, 16:44 - onur: <Media omitted>
11/08/2025, 16:46 - Will-hazzer777: I'm not sure this is true... I.e. they don't know how to have sex... That just doesn't square with their birth rates...
11/08/2025, 16:46 - +44 7516 029853: But there is also a huge difference inside Europe when it comes to this topic
11/08/2025, 16:46 - Ali: Belly buttons Will..
11/08/2025, 16:46 - Will-hazzer777: Well that's how it ends... I know that much...
11/08/2025, 16:47 - +353 89 605 0161: That's where we all begin!
11/08/2025, 16:47 - Will-hazzer777: Precisely
11/08/2025, 16:47 - onur: U dont need to reach orgasm to have babies?

11/08/2025, 16:47 - Ali: <Media omitted>
11/08/2025, 16:47 - Will-hazzer777: Or not begin at all... Depending how the start ended...
11/08/2025, 16:48 - +44 7958 612614: you don't have to have babies to reach orgasm
11/08/2025, 16:48 - Ali: <Media omitted>
11/08/2025, 16:48 - +44 7958 612614: i'd say orgasm is more important
11/08/2025, 16:48 - onur: That is also true
11/08/2025, 16:48 - +44 7958 612614: give me likes if you believe orgasm is more important than babies
11/08/2025, 16:48 - +44 7516 029853: That is conservative propaganda, Onur!
Don't listen to them
11/08/2025, 16:49 - +44 7516 029853: no likes yet!
11/08/2025, 16:49 - Will-hazzer777: It's totally worth it...
11/08/2025, 16:49 - +44 7958 612614: let it sink in
11/08/2025, 16:49 - +44 7516 029853: I think it is the fall of Western society as it happens
11/08/2025, 16:50 - Will-hazzer777: Babies are important so that there are people in future who have orgasms...
11/08/2025, 16:50 - +44 7958 612614: the harder they COME, the harder they fall..
11/08/2025, 16:50 - Will-hazzer777: No babies no orgasms
11/08/2025, 16:51 - Will-hazzer777: It's chicken and egg...
11/08/2025, 16:51 - Ali: Mothers need orgasms to bond with their baby during birthing them apparently. Don’t know how true that is, but it kinda makes sense.
11/08/2025, 16:51 - Will-hazzer777: Oxytocin
11/08/2025, 16:51 - +44 7958 612614: that's not our problem. focus on your own orgasm, lobster
11/08/2025, 16:52 - Ali: Thought I could smell fish…
11/08/2025, 16:52 - Will-hazzer777: I am very shellfish
11/08/2025, 16:52 - +44 7958 612614: sounds like something @⁨Parag-meetup⁩ and @⁨onur⁩ thought of while having sex together <This message was edited>

11/08/2025, 16:53 - +353 89 605 0161: You should warn people before you tell them their mum orgasmed on them
11/08/2025, 16:53 - Ali: It’s selfish to be selfless and selfish to be shellfish
11/08/2025, 16:53 - +44 7516 029853: It even has its own term
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthgasm
11/08/2025, 16:53 - Ali: Oh absolutely. Then wrote a report about it afterwards.
11/08/2025, 16:54 - Will-hazzer777: Babies need to ingest their mother's vaginal fluids to have a healthy microbiome.
11/08/2025, 16:54 - +44 7958 612614: and put it through chatGPT to make the sexy
11/08/2025, 16:55 - Ali: That’s great. Thanks for letting me know.
11/08/2025, 16:55 - +44 7958 612614: have you been on a spiritual retreat the last six months??
11/08/2025, 16:55 - +44 7516 029853: And it is available in English only. Proves my theory I have not shared here yet
11/08/2025, 16:56 - Ali: Nah just to the nuthouse
11/08/2025, 16:56 - +353 89 605 0161: Sounds like MAP propaganda
11/08/2025, 16:56 - Ali: Same thing probably

11/08/2025, 17:03 - +44 7958 612614: think about it... pain / pleasure
11/08/2025, 17:04 - Will-hazzer777: Who is having the orgasm?
11/08/2025, 17:05 - Ali: He’s just thinking about his dad
11/08/2025, 17:05 - Will-hazzer777: It sounds too much incest to me...

"Everyone can see we're together
As we walk on by
(And) And we flock just like birds of a feather
I won't tell no lie
(All) All of the people around us, they say
"Can they be that close?"
Just let me state for the record
We're giving love in a family dose"
11/08/2025, 17:33 - Will-hazzer777: "The couple met when she was 13 and he was 18 when Philip gave Elizabeth and her sister Margaret a tour of the Royal Navy college where he studied.

Elizabeth was introduced to her future husband, the then-Prince Philip of Greece and Denmark and told the pair were third cousins."

12/08/2025, 12:22 - +44 7516 029853: I guess the moral of the story: do it with your friends 😂
12/08/2025, 12:24 - +44 7516 029853: I must admit I kissed the boys I met an hour ago but I don't like sharing the bottle of water with friends. It's silly
12/08/2025, 12:26 - onur: Someone wrote the latter is the reason for the first ;D
12/08/2025, 12:28 - onur: I share the water bottle but don’t really eat genitalia especially if it is the first time :D
12/08/2025, 12:28 - +44 7516 029853: That's cute 😊
12/08/2025, 12:31 - +44 7516 029853: But if you kiss on the first date, it's not that hygienic as well
12/08/2025, 12:33 - +44 7958 612614: well, you intentionally shared bodily fluids in the first instance - in the second -you wanted clean water
12/08/2025, 12:34 - onur: Yeah I have kissed a first date before, I admit it is not really hygienic :D

Especially after learning most europeans dont really wash their mouths after eating
12/08/2025, 12:35 - onur: I carry this pack of baby wipes (because they are mostly water and tasteless) with me most of the time, and I cant really count the times I got a reaction when I pulled it out after eating to at least clean my mouth <This message was edited>
12/08/2025, 12:36 - +44 7516 029853: Speaking of friends, one of my besties invited me to join her for a rapid STD and HIV check on 2 January. I always knew she was cool, but that really impressed me.
12/08/2025, 12:36 - onur: Whats cool about STD and HIV
12/08/2025, 12:36 - onur: :D
12/08/2025, 12:37 - +44 7516 029853: Silly Europeans making the Turkish boy cringe 😂
12/08/2025, 12:38 - +44 7516 029853: Oh, you have germophobia as well🫸🏻
12/08/2025, 12:38 - onur: Yeah I heard this but like its not germophobia its like basic hygiene :D
12/08/2025, 12:38 - onur: Its not like I am cleaning everywhere before I sit etc
12/08/2025, 12:39 - onur: I just dont like to feel food residue and fat/ oils on my mouth
12/08/2025, 12:40 - onur: + u can clean the table with it if u want if its really dirty or if you need to go to the toilet idk, its handy then :D its multi purpose
12/08/2025, 12:43 - +44 7516 029853: I always have a pack of wet wipes with me too. 
I have very sensitive skin, so if my hands aren't clean, I can't concentrate. I read it might be interconnected with ADHD
12/08/2025, 12:45 - +44 7516 029853: I always thought I paid much more attention to cleaning and hygiene until I met a friend who is a biologist. Turns out I am quite chill 😂
12/08/2025, 12:46 - onur: Yeah similar
12/08/2025, 12:46 - onur: I think there is a spectrum :D it is fine to be in the middle

knowing you don't have them 🤣

but it was cool that if done together, it is not that scary and even fun, as we were chatting the whole time while waiting for the results
12/08/2025, 13:07 - Ali: I’m really enjoying this chat
12/08/2025, 13:08 - Ali: Reminds me of the old days of philosophy when people knew what laughter and banter was

Can't believe it's illegal 🙄
13/08/2025, 09:10 - +353 89 605 0161: I'd like to carry it as a man too, just for people who are slightly annoying.
Playing music on trains/buses etc...
13/08/2025, 09:11 - +44 7516 029853: I was carrying a knife because it was handy, but the fact that pepper sprays are illegal - outrageous
13/08/2025, 09:11 - +44 7516 029853: Maybe we all could have taken a test, and if you're alright (regardless of gender), a pepper spray license is given
13/08/2025, 09:12 - +44 7516 029853: I was once attacked on the streets in Toronto (by a woman). It's strict there too, so I was carrying a tactical torch after the incident <This message was edited>

13/08/2025, 09:19 - +44 7446 051842: It can blind people.
13/08/2025, 09:19 - +44 7516 029853: Is it supposed to, or you mean permanent damage?
13/08/2025, 09:20 - +44 7446 051842: Permanent damage.
13/08/2025, 09:20 - +44 7446 051842: I’m already pretty unhappy that police use it.
13/08/2025, 09:20 - +44 7446 051842: The modern day peppery sprays aren’t really a spray at all.
13/08/2025, 09:21 - +44 7446 051842: They are a gelatinous substance, that sticks to your skin.
13/08/2025, 09:22 - +44 7446 051842: The police testing is done in an environment where after 1 minute the test subject can dunk their head into a barrel of water, and even then it is brutal. However in most protest environments where it is used, there is no water in sight and definately not enough to get it off your skin or out of your eyes.
13/08/2025, 09:22 - +44 7446 051842: If too much of it is in your eyes too long, you’re finished.
13/08/2025, 09:23 - +353 89 605 0161: 🤔 You've convinced me.
I don't want pepper spray, I don't want to be blinding people.
13/08/2025, 09:24 - +353 89 605 0161: I wish I could carry a water cannon instead
13/08/2025, 09:26 - +44 7446 051842: Yeah but it’d be so peak if you are walking around London and you hear. ‘Hey what size shoes are you, bro?’ before someone whips out a water cannon.
13/08/2025, 09:31 - +44 7446 051842: At protests if protesters are pushing up against barriers, it’s a bit of an obscene crash out for a police officer to pepper spray them. Like I’d much rather get rugby tackled.
13/08/2025, 09:32 - +44 7446 051842: <Media omitted>
13/08/2025, 09:35 - +353 89 605 0161: I'd prefer to be seized. 
"Seize him!" 
Always wanted to be he who was seized.
13/08/2025, 09:35 - +44 7446 051842: Incredibly valid.
13/08/2025, 10:34 - Ali: Deodorant spray is a good alternative to pepper spray… always carry one around if you can
13/08/2025, 10:34 - Ali: Little mini one
13/08/2025, 10:35 - Ali: Or a taser …
13/08/2025, 10:35 - Ali: ;)
13/08/2025, 10:44 - +44 7446 051842: Guys the ‘peaceful’ Nash Equilibrium in society is better than the ‘individualistic’ Nash Equilibrium in society.
13/08/2025, 10:46 - onur: Knife is also illegal
13/08/2025, 11:01 - +353 89 605 0161: Can you have a peaceful Nash equilibrium?
If nobody is carrying an offensive weapon, then everyone would improve their position by being the one who changes their strategy by carrying one.

Its more like some multiplayer prisoners dilemma where only when everyone has a weapon there is Nash equilibrium <This message was edited>
13/08/2025, 11:06 - onur: <Media omitted>
13/08/2025, 11:06 - onur: Not for financial reasons
13/08/2025, 11:06 - onur: 😅
13/08/2025, 11:08 - +44 7446 051842: You can, because the people that carry the knives will get demonised and arrested. In a situation where everyone carries knives, police will stop enforcing it, and it won’t be demonised.
13/08/2025, 11:10 - +44 7446 051842: In a situation where the good peace is kept, everyone likes not switching their strategy. <This message was edited>
13/08/2025, 11:12 - +44 7446 051842: I think this is only half the full picture.
13/08/2025, 11:14 - +44 7446 051842: I think we actually live in the bad Nash equilibrium timeline for meat eating, and drinking. <This message was edited>
13/08/2025, 11:16 - +44 7446 051842: America is in the bad Nash equilibrium for offensive weapons.
13/08/2025, 11:17 - +353 89 605 0161: If the police are players then they would then be better off unilaterally changing their strategy away from enforcing anti knife measures (stop and search, ad campaigns etc...) since nobody is carying knives anyway.
So it's not nash eq with them in it either.
13/08/2025, 11:18 - +44 7446 051842: Lots of people carry knives Alex.
13/08/2025, 11:19 - +44 7446 051842: The police aren’t exactly players. They are more part of the set up for the game.
13/08/2025, 11:19 - +353 89 605 0161: This is the fictitious peaceful nash tho, not real world
13/08/2025, 11:20 - +353 89 605 0161: Hmm, if they're not players then I see how it can work.
13/08/2025, 11:20 - +44 7446 051842: Ah, peace does actually need to be kept. I’m personally against the police existing permanently but we’d need to restructure society to get rid of them.
13/08/2025, 11:21 - +44 7446 051842: Education, Higher level education being made public, healthcare, drug rehabilitation, drug decriminalisation. <This message was edited>
13/08/2025, 11:21 - +44 7446 051842: Prison rehabilitation.
13/08/2025, 11:22 - +44 7446 051842: All need to be in place before I’d be cool with abolishing the police force gradually.
13/08/2025, 11:22 - +44 7446 051842: Also we would have to create a culture where people actually intervene with what happens around them.
13/08/2025, 11:23 - +44 7446 051842: Individualism causes the bystander effect.
13/08/2025, 11:24 - +353 89 605 0161: All we need for the abolition of the police is for all the things that make them necessary to be fixed.
Hard to argue with that!
13/08/2025, 11:25 - +44 7446 051842: Some people think the police are necessary for eternity.
13/08/2025, 11:26 - +353 89 605 0161: I think that would be because they don't subscribe to the idea that all criminal activity is the result of economic/educational conditions
13/08/2025, 11:27 - +44 7446 051842: Yeah makes sense.
13/08/2025, 12:37 - +44 7516 029853: So.
One day I was walking back home in London. A homeless person asked me for change, but I didn't give them money (I have no soul). Then he started shouting at me screaming "No one in this fucking city wants to help!!!". I was scared and later complained about the incident to friends. 
But then I remembered that in the New York subway, it's very popular to be a victim of a particular crime. Homeless people carry a lighter and a spray deodorant. They ask you for money and make sure you can see their equipment (threatening to fire you on the spot). Very high success rate, don't remember even one story when they didn't get money. American social engineering 🔥🥲🫠 <This message was edited>

13/08/2025, 14:30 - Ali: Scary when things like that happen to you. I had a similar thing the other week.. a woman asked me to buy something from the shop and that she has the money (showed me the money in her hand). So I said “well if you’ve got the money, then you go to the shop” and she started shouting at me and calling me names. I laughed at the time but it was a bit scary… thought I was gonna get stabbed or something. It happens a lot here in London. There’s always something these days… <This message was edited>

13/08/2025, 14:41 - +353 89 605 0161: I think you posted a video of you or a friend ice skating some time ago.
With the the data available I have extrapolated and determined you split your time equally between this group, the pub and ice skating.
A simple life 👌
13/08/2025, 14:51 - +44 7516 029853: I was strip searched for hours at the Israeli border. 
It sounds scarier than it was, though. I was just silly and answered a question jokingly, but they didn't appreciate the humour 🥲
13/08/2025, 14:54 - Will-hazzer777: I don't remember posting any videos of myself ice skating...
13/08/2025, 14:54 - +44 7516 029853: They were so serious, they made my (now ex) partner go through the experience as well (told him to go back even though he already passed the search at that point). They even cross-interrogated us lol
13/08/2025, 14:54 - Ali: Haha something I would do. Then you end up digging a massive hole for yourself 😂 and before you know it you’ve got a strangers arm in an unfamiliar place
13/08/2025, 14:55 - +44 7516 029853: The most important thing, the joke wasn't even funny..... Like it was obviously dumb
13/08/2025, 14:55 - Will-hazzer777: In an unfamiliar place? 😅
13/08/2025, 14:56 - Ali: I was going to mention fisting initially but had to make it more PC
13/08/2025, 14:56 - Will-hazzer777: Nervous humour.... Are you the type of person who laughs at a funeral?
13/08/2025, 14:56 - Will-hazzer777: "The place" must be familiar however...
13/08/2025, 14:56 - Will-hazzer777: No?
13/08/2025, 14:57 - +44 7516 029853: The joke was actually about a cemetery.

 - what were you doing in Israel? 
- visiting cemeteries aahahahaba 😂😂😂😂
13/08/2025, 14:58 - +44 7516 029853: 2 hours of strip search and cross-interrogation!!! <This message was edited>

13/08/2025, 14:58 - Ali: They probably just fancied you
13/08/2025, 14:58 - Will-hazzer777: Or is it like an unfit person finding out they have aching muscles they never knew they had after going for a run?
13/08/2025, 14:59 - +44 7516 029853: Or my ex partner
13/08/2025, 14:59 - Will-hazzer777: Could have made it more fun if they mixed it up with a poker game and some Jack Daniels.
13/08/2025, 15:01 - +44 7516 029853: The most embarrassing thing was not even the semi-consensual touches, it was quite shitty to see how much rubbish I had in my luggage, as they looked into every pocket I had <This message was edited>

13/08/2025, 15:11 - +44 7516 029853: It was a few years ago, maybe it has changed
13/08/2025, 15:11 - Will-hazzer777: Do you think the search was justified though?
13/08/2025, 15:15 - +44 7516 029853: Don't think so. I honestly don't know what was the point of having a physical examination after each scan (wasn't it enough that the sophisticated scans were showing them I was ok?) 
But it might have been bad timing or something else. Also, maybe they have randomised checks and I happened to trigger it by being silly, idk.
13/08/2025, 15:17 - +44 7516 029853: And they made me go through the scans repeatedly. Fiy, the scans for the enhanced check were different, more fine tuned and looked quite futuristic.
13/08/2025, 15:21 - +353 89 605 0161: I bet they're fake.
They're hollow, with a little speaker in them that beeps and boops

13/08/2025, 15:32 - Will-hazzer777: Interesting theory
13/08/2025, 15:33 - Will-hazzer777: Would explain the need for physical examination.

14/08/2025, 17:01 - +44 7516 029853: Some forms or violence are justified if used as a form of (self)-protection. Though based on the description of the video Onur posted, it's quite mindless

14/08/2025, 17:06 - Will-hazzer777: Speech is violence too
14/08/2025, 17:06 - Will-hazzer777: So nothing is not violence to someone.
14/08/2025, 17:06 - Ali: Silent but violent
14/08/2025, 17:06 - Ali: 😂😂😂
14/08/2025, 17:06 - Ali: Sorry… fart joke
14/08/2025, 17:06 - Will-hazzer777: Silent and deadly

(speaking of lesbians we discussed previously)
14/08/2025, 21:26 - +44 7516 029853: jokes aside, perhaps the only real perk of being a woman, is that you can be certain that it's much easier to get help in case of emergency, sometimes even without asking for help someone shows up.

boys, on the other hand, be like:
 _male loneliness epidemic_ 
also men when they need to discuss challenging feelings: 🤐
14/08/2025, 21:40 - onur: https://www.psychologicalscience.org/news/2024-february-love-gender-gap.html
14/08/2025, 21:40 - onur: This might be the source
14/08/2025, 21:40 - onur: So its like statement of feeling loved
14/08/2025, 21:42 - onur: Yeah and gender quotas xd
14/08/2025, 21:43 - onur: Or if u have above average physique u can have an of and make more than an athlete
14/08/2025, 21:55 - Ali: It depends on whether people know what love actually is. I think it’s hard to define it. Everyone interprets it differently… then there is limerence and lust vs love. 

The realisation of whether you loved or didn’t love someone, occurs in hindsight too most of the time.
14/08/2025, 21:56 - Ali: Are they talking about love or validation?

15/08/2025, 11:26 - +44 7516 029853: Onur, why would you post something like this? 🫠
15/08/2025, 11:41 - onur: reference to this
15/08/2025, 11:41 - onur: it is one of the comments
15/08/2025, 12:13 - +44 7516 029853: I mean both the show (I am glad I didn't know about it before) and the "meme" are disturbing <This message was edited>
15/08/2025, 12:14 - +44 7516 029853: Kind regards,
15/08/2025, 12:14 - +44 7516 029853: Captain Obvious
15/08/2025, 12:15 - onur: Why do you think it is disturbing
15/08/2025, 12:15 - onur: Also some memes could make us feel disturbed
15/08/2025, 12:24 - +44 7516 029853: Mostly because it judges the physical appearance of both women and implies that there is something wrong with the way they look.
15/08/2025, 12:30 - onur: https://www.instagram.com/reel/DNWDGx8uLDs/?igsh=Z3VlOHRsOGRvYTh6
15/08/2025, 12:31 - onur: Ok rise and shine people judge physical appearances
15/08/2025, 12:32 - onur: I think whats disturbing here is how crowd reacts after the face reveal, she is pretty as fuck :D
15/08/2025, 12:34 - +44 7958 612614: yeah, and those people are called losers 🤣
15/08/2025, 12:34 - onur: Everyone judges everyones appearances
15/08/2025, 12:34 - onur: It is an evolutionary mechanism
15/08/2025, 12:34 - +44 7958 612614: no, i disagree
15/08/2025, 12:35 - +44 7958 612614: I can like something or not and not judge
15/08/2025, 12:35 - onur: You are wrong then like 100x other instances
15/08/2025, 12:35 - +44 7958 612614: probably 🙂
15/08/2025, 12:37 - onur: It’s not about being shallow, it’s an instinct. Our brains evolved to quickly read physical traits as signals; health, age, strength, fertility, trustworthiness. This kind of snap judgement was useful for survival long before modern society existed. We still do it, even if we don’t act on it consciously
15/08/2025, 12:37 - +44 7958 612614: oh, let me guess - it’s because of evolution.  Wow, you’re a fucking genius! <This message was edited>
15/08/2025, 12:37 - onur: Idk how u kept yourself alive until now
15/08/2025, 12:38 - +44 7958 612614: of course, because of luck - there’s only evolution and luck - that’s it!  Rodney, you’re a bloody genius!
15/08/2025, 12:39 - onur: Thanks
15/08/2025, 12:41 - +44 7958 612614: That was irony - did you really believe I thought you were a genius?  My desk calculator is more insightful than you.  I’d still rather have a drink with you than with a calculator, so you win
15/08/2025, 12:41 - +44 7516 029853: They are both clearly attractive, and the crowd is disgusting, indeed. 
And we all do judge the way people look, do not want to even pretend it is not the case. 
What I think is crucial is to progress a bit further than monkeys and not make shows and memes about our personal preferences regarding physical appearance. Also, it tends to be a clear pattern that it is women who are predominantly judged and ridiculed for their appearance (even if they are conventionally attractive), not men (though I do not want shows like Butterface to be reversed and used against men too)
15/08/2025, 12:42 - +44 7958 612614: lol, like monkeys are worse than us in that respect?
15/08/2025, 12:43 - onur: <Media omitted>
15/08/2025, 12:43 - Ali: You’re wrong Martin. I constantly judge @⁨onur⁩ on how he looks.
15/08/2025, 12:43 - onur: Zendaya looks like a boy tho :D
15/08/2025, 12:44 - +44 7516 029853: You are right, monkeys choose their partners based on their personality and the deep conversation they have before reproducing.
15/08/2025, 12:44 - +44 7958 612614: He just needs to straighten up his lobster back and he’ll be fine.  Try dropping him into boiling water first 😉
15/08/2025, 12:45 - +44 7958 612614: at least they are not watching porn while they are at it
15/08/2025, 12:45 - +44 7958 612614: Maybe they are?
15/08/2025, 12:45 - onur: <Media omitted>

15/08/2025, 12:58 - +44 7958 612614: evolution!
15/08/2025, 12:58 - Will-hazzer777: No... Projection
15/08/2025, 12:59 - +44 7958 612614: evolution + projector = projection
15/08/2025, 12:59 - +44 7958 612614: I can explain everything using 1 word, that’s it
15/08/2025, 12:59 - +44 7958 612614: universal theory of everything - evolution
15/08/2025, 13:00 - Will-hazzer777: It doesn't explain non-living things.
15/08/2025, 13:00 - +44 7958 612614: test me
15/08/2025, 13:00 - +44 7958 612614: virtually everything, just ask me
15/08/2025, 13:00 - Will-hazzer777: How does it explain quarks?
15/08/2025, 13:01 - +44 7958 612614: they’ve been in the making for millions of years - so time and luck
15/08/2025, 13:01 - +44 7958 612614: next
15/08/2025, 13:02 - +44 7958 612614: btw - were you referring to quacky quarks or quirky quarks?
15/08/2025, 13:02 - +44 7958 612614: it works for both
15/08/2025, 13:04 - +44 7958 612614: life is the easiest:  life emerged from non-living chemistry under early Earth conditions.  Once life began, natural selection shaped it into the diversity we see today.  the entire theory of life in 2 sentences.  I can’t create a web server in GoLang using a shorter syntax
15/08/2025, 13:05 - Will-hazzer777: Up, down, strange, charm, top, bottom etc..
15/08/2025, 13:07 - +44 7958 612614: Mind you - word “complexity” has been used a lot recently for when things don’t work according to the rules.  Can we find a terrorist in a cave, half way across the globe?  YES!  Can we arrest a hoodie stealing mobile phones in central london?  It’s complex!
15/08/2025, 13:08 - Will-hazzer777: We can find the terrorist but we can't arrest them because that would be a breech if their human rights.
15/08/2025, 13:08 - +44 7958 612614: sure, that’s why we kill them using drones.  Then prosecute a drone - but is the drone a signatory to the ICJ?
15/08/2025, 13:09 - Will-hazzer777: It took a while to find Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan because he was actually in Pakistan being hidden by their government.
15/08/2025, 13:09 - +44 7958 612614: Yep, again - everything is explained by time….
15/08/2025, 13:09 - Will-hazzer777: We can't arrest a hoodie... You can only hug them.
15/08/2025, 13:09 - +44 7958 612614: time and luck
15/08/2025, 13:09 - +44 7958 612614: I’ll give you a hug
15/08/2025, 13:10 - Will-hazzer777: I'm not a hoodie
15/08/2025, 13:11 - Will-hazzer777: The drone operator then...
15/08/2025, 13:11 - +44 7958 612614: the AI
15/08/2025, 13:12 - Will-hazzer777: The manufacturer
15/08/2025, 13:12 - +44 7958 612614: Acme Inc.
15/08/2025, 13:13 - +44 7958 612614: A little company from South Sudan, a man and his goat
15/08/2025, 13:13 - +44 7958 612614: we’ll go after them!
15/08/2025, 13:13 - Will-hazzer777: The icc will
15/08/2025, 13:14 - Will-hazzer777: They'll hang the goat at the Hague

The rest is true
15/08/2025, 16:07 - onur: 😹
15/08/2025, 16:07 - onur: I cant refine it that well its just a dumb prompt haha
15/08/2025, 16:09 - +44 7516 029853: but it, in fact, predicted quite well the most common female phenotype in Moldova
15/08/2025, 16:10 - onur: Yeah my prompt was heavily racist
15/08/2025, 16:10 - +44 7516 029853: shocking!
15/08/2025, 16:10 - onur: Like BALD SERBIAN GUY
15/08/2025, 16:10 - onur: How else?
15/08/2025, 16:11 - onur: U need to be some sort of descriptive
15/08/2025, 16:12 - +44 7516 029853: fine-tuning the prompt - life is tough, innit?
15/08/2025, 16:12 - onur: I can make it really good but i need to sink time
15/08/2025, 16:13 - +44 7516 029853: you can ask LLM to make a prompt for you
15/08/2025, 16:13 - onur: Thats what I did but that also needs refinement after a trial and error process
15/08/2025, 16:15 - +44 7599 430972: I’m pretty sure none of the Alexes have beards
15/08/2025, 16:15 - +44 7599 430972: Our testosterone levels won’t allow
15/08/2025, 16:15 - Ali: Aww that’s so cute! Where are you though?
15/08/2025, 16:16 - +44 7599 430972: Stoned out of frame
15/08/2025, 16:16 - onur: I am message removed by admin
15/08/2025, 16:16 - onur: :D
15/08/2025, 16:17 - onur: Lool i just wrote a group of Alexs arguing
15/08/2025, 16:18 - Ali: And Alex 1 looks like @⁨Will-hazzer777⁩
15/08/2025, 16:22 - onur: Mine and wills lines didnt go through because of the woke filters
15/08/2025, 16:23 - +44 7599 430972: Literally 1984
15/08/2025, 16:42 - +44 7516 029853: I had a pint with an Alex from the chat the other day. But due to privacy reasons can't disclose if he has a beard 😶
15/08/2025, 16:51 - onur: The OG alex dont have a beard so that is all that matters
15/08/2025, 17:07 - onur: Will supposed to say immigrants go home and mine was saying I hate women and armenians
15/08/2025, 17:08 - onur: they were the real funny part but yeah :D
15/08/2025, 17:13 - +44 7446 051842: I actually critisize this deeply, on the basis that it enforces patriachy.
15/08/2025, 17:15 - +44 7446 051842: Yes ethno-violence is mindless.
15/08/2025, 17:15 - +44 7446 051842: I think modern day conflict is definately in the more advanced parts of our brain.
15/08/2025, 17:16 - onur: Just seeing this, appreciated.
15/08/2025, 17:16 - +44 7446 051842: Difficult to measure so I think this is technically bullshit, but I think it has an underlying truth in its attempt in social commentary.
15/08/2025, 17:16 - +44 7516 029853: fiy, that was a joke
15/08/2025, 17:17 - +44 7446 051842: Ah.
15/08/2025, 17:17 - +44 7446 051842: I’m being silly.
15/08/2025, 17:18 - +44 7446 051842: A lot of North Koreans probably say they feel loved and love their government so I think this is difficult to measure.
15/08/2025, 17:18 - onur: Yeah I guess thats true
15/08/2025, 17:18 - +44 7516 029853: plot twist, you end up falling in love with an Armenian woman
15/08/2025, 17:19 - +44 7516 029853: but she rejects you because you're sexist and deny genocide
15/08/2025, 17:19 - +44 7516 029853: 🔥🔥🔥
15/08/2025, 17:19 - onur: Deny what?
15/08/2025, 17:19 - onur: :D
15/08/2025, 17:19 - +44 7446 051842: Interesting.
15/08/2025, 17:20 - onur: Jokes aside I hope everyone is aware that I dont have a problem with any gender or ethnicity
15/08/2025, 17:20 - onur: :D
15/08/2025, 17:20 - +44 7446 051842: Quirky.
15/08/2025, 17:20 - +44 7446 051842: That is a truth lived not said.
15/08/2025, 17:22 - onur: everyone I know is immigrant and women > men tbh so idk how I can showcase these to you but yeah I see what u mean
15/08/2025, 17:23 - +44 7446 051842: I believe you completely, I was just denying your ability to make that claim. I have faith in you as an individual.
15/08/2025, 17:24 - onur: I think I can summarize humour as unexpected stuff within your moral zone

since my moral compass is lost I like jokes that are edgy
15/08/2025, 17:26 - +44 7516 029853: One of my most favourite clips
https://youtu.be/mwS9H14jLvQ
15/08/2025, 17:30 - onur: ahh because they used to do this instead of abortion
15/08/2025, 17:30 - onur: omg hahahaha
15/08/2025, 17:31 - onur: well written joke
15/08/2025, 17:32 - onur: or not
15/08/2025, 17:32 - onur: I am not sure if I understood correctly :D
15/08/2025, 17:38 - +44 7446 051842: It is.
15/08/2025, 17:40 - +44 7446 051842: That’s descriptive, when Christina is being prescriptive.
15/08/2025, 17:42 - +44 7446 051842: So are allergic attacks, rape, etc. Not everything that is an evolutionary mechanism is necessarily good.
15/08/2025, 17:43 - +44 7446 051842: Yes.
15/08/2025, 17:43 - +44 7446 051842: I think that photo is quite bad.
15/08/2025, 17:44 - onur: They are not related to survival tho
15/08/2025, 17:44 - +44 7446 051842: So? (I am incredibly bisexual) (Satire)
15/08/2025, 17:44 - onur: She has many bad photos
15/08/2025, 17:45 - onur: It is what it is, if you like girls who look like bois then be my guest
15/08/2025, 17:45 - +44 7446 051842: Allergic reactions evolved to destroy pathogens. Rape evolved  in most creatures so we could reproduce despite circumstance, both are horrible. Both are evolution. Evolution is not a measure of goodness. <This message was edited>
15/08/2025, 17:47 - onur: Well evolution is random stuff happening and turning out to be helpful in survival so that is kept through generations

Rape has never applied in spite of survival of a generation as far as I know, allergic reactions might have a benefit tho yeah idk have to check
15/08/2025, 17:47 - onur: Rape is kept for humiliation or punishment more I guess
15/08/2025, 17:47 - onur: They are social constructs
15/08/2025, 17:47 - +44 7446 051842: We have transcended our need for these mechanisms. (I think we never needed them in the first place.) <This message was edited>

15/08/2025, 17:48 - +44 7446 051842: In the same way, we have transcended our need to judge people based on looks.
15/08/2025, 17:48 - +44 7516 029853: We didn't
15/08/2025, 17:48 - +44 7446 051842: My bad.
15/08/2025, 17:49 - onur: Rape was clasified as rape like in modern times bro
15/08/2025, 17:49 - +44 7446 051842: So was trees.
15/08/2025, 17:49 - onur: Nah :D
15/08/2025, 17:49 - +44 7446 051842: They always existed before classification.
15/08/2025, 17:49 - +44 7446 051842: Modern in the scale of trees existing.
15/08/2025, 17:49 - onur: If something isnt described it doesnt exist

15/08/2025, 17:50 - +44 7446 051842: Things that we can’t articulate can be a problem.
15/08/2025, 17:50 - +44 7446 051842: Rape was always an issue.
15/08/2025, 17:51 - +44 7516 029853: 1. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo_effect
2. Humans judge faces in incomplete photographs as physically more attractive https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31924811/
15/08/2025, 17:51 - +44 7446 051842: The fact we are debating this in insane.
15/08/2025, 17:52 - +44 7446 051842: Be right back.
15/08/2025, 17:52 - onur: There are still countries who doesnt recognise rape
15/08/2025, 18:28 - Ali: Brb just drinking ginger beer

15/08/2025, 21:48 - +44 7446 051842: The debate has to be had there, and I don’t think anything is off limits for a conversation but do you not think rape was always an issue?
15/08/2025, 22:05 - onur: issue like what
15/08/2025, 22:05 - onur: its moral and judicial implications are like really modern
15/08/2025, 22:07 - onur: The earliest written law codes we know of — from the ancient Near East — already contained provisions against non-consensual sex, though their framing was very different from today’s.

Code of Ur-Nammu (Sumer, c. 2100 BCE) — the oldest surviving law code. Surviving fragments suggest a penalty (often death) for forcing sex with another man’s wife. This was framed as a property violation against the husband, not the woman.

Code of Hammurabi (Babylon, c. 1750 BCE) — detailed laws on sexual offences. If a man raped a betrothed virgin in her father’s house, he was executed; if it happened in a public place, both parties might be punished if “consent” was unclear. Again, the offence was treated as damaging a family’s property or honour, not as an individual rights violation.
15/08/2025, 22:07 - onur: hmm perhaps not when its someone elses property :D
15/08/2025, 22:09 - onur: like I guess up until 1900s u had slaves
15/08/2025, 22:09 - onur: rape in wars was prohibited first time in Geneva convention

maybe I don't need those silly distinctive names in my contact list, instead I need to call everyone Alex and add a number, without judgement.

Alex 1.
Alex 2.

It's such a fluid term these days it means so many different things to so many different people it's become practically meaningless and therefore difficult to substantiate or negate with any precision. <This message was edited>
16/08/2025, 12:50 - Will-hazzer777: This is another clear example of the high levels of literacy, (at least amongst men, though this was written by a female prostitute) in early European civilization.

What did you like about the museum, though?
16/08/2025, 13:01 - Ali: I think the gift shop was the most exciting thing. All those books in there to browse through 😅
16/08/2025, 13:01 - Ali: It’s an interesting .. cult .. can I call it that?
16/08/2025, 13:02 - Will-hazzer777: Be polite....'Secret society'...
16/08/2025, 13:03 - Ali: Tickle tickle
16/08/2025, 13:05 - +44 7516 029853: Oh, the museum gift shops! 🔥 The most romantic places on Earth. Have elements of both eros (perceived knowledge due to proximity to the artefacts) and thanatos (commercialisation and artificial selection, rigidity and moral decay).

16/08/2025, 22:19 - +44 7446 051842: I think respecting someone’s opinion is a phrase that gets misused. 
A doctor might think a vaccine is the best thing for a kid, but an anti-vaccin parent may not want that kid to be vaccinated. A doctor who doesn’t vaccinate that kid is ‘respecting the opinion’ of the parents. As they have authority. One can not respect another’s opinion without changing an action.

17/08/2025, 10:46 - Parag-meetup: Also keeps you busy with numbers and then makes you homeless

no way AI isn't on top, so it's clearly outdated 😆
17/08/2025, 10:49 - onur: So the least attractive is the bottom
17/08/2025, 10:50 - Parag-meetup: Bottoms are not attractive sometimes

17/08/2025, 10:55 - +44 7516 029853: Situation: you enter his room and he has a book about playing piano in Spanish or some other cool language 😍
17/08/2025, 10:56 - +44 7516 029853: and there is food he cooked on a table he made himself
17/08/2025, 10:56 - +44 7516 029853: bloody hell..... 🥲
17/08/2025, 10:57 - onur: Who would learn playing piano from spanish?
17/08/2025, 10:57 - onur: 😂
17/08/2025, 10:58 - +44 7516 029853: I was teaching piano myself at some point, but if he can read, speak, woodwork, and cook, I am ready to take piano lessons 😂
17/08/2025, 11:01 - onur: <Media omitted>
17/08/2025, 11:02 - +44 7446 051842: If I was a woman, I wouldn’t find archery, blacksmithing, woodworking or gardening attractive or astronomy attractive, but the rest I can totally see why.
17/08/2025, 11:03 - onur: They are like the only legit hobbies in the list :D
17/08/2025, 11:03 - +44 7446 051842: My tear rolled down my dyslexic face.
17/08/2025, 11:03 - +44 7516 029853: Why not? 
archery is just cool, blacksmithing and woodworking is something quite primal, which is usually hot, astronomy is romantic and smart
17/08/2025, 11:03 - +44 7446 051842: Musical instrument?
17/08/2025, 11:03 - onur: Both genders can do it and would be cool
17/08/2025, 11:03 - +44 7446 051842: I wouldn’t call blacksmithing primal. Archery just doesn’t do it for me.
17/08/2025, 11:03 - onur: But the ones you listed are like more male focused
17/08/2025, 11:03 - +44 7446 051842: Yeah it’s universally focused.
17/08/2025, 11:04 - onur: I would say writing as well since women cant write well
17/08/2025, 11:04 - onur: 🤪
17/08/2025, 11:05 - +44 7446 051842: I don’t understand the appeal that woodworking gives? Astronomy is a very complex one, but essentially knowing that stars aren’t special may remove the fun of gazing at them.
17/08/2025, 11:05 - +44 7446 051842: ‘Hey, look at the stars tonight…’ 
‘Yeah that one is Alpha Centuri B it is a white dwarf, it’s surface temperature is 1973982 C and it has 9 orbital planets one of which made of sulphur called Zeus’s asscrack…’ <This message was edited>

17/08/2025, 11:07 - +44 7516 029853: >woodworking 

Can do things with his own hands. It's quite physical, but one also needs to be smart to make it well. Idk, it's just cool
17/08/2025, 11:07 - +44 7446 051842: Advanced lego but okay.
17/08/2025, 11:08 - +44 7446 051842: Cooking is fit because I can’t cook, and atleast one of us needs to understand cooking.
17/08/2025, 11:08 - +44 7516 029853: My ex-partner was showing me the Moon through the telescope he had to fine-tune, and it was not as boring as you described it. It's knowledge+adventure+curiosity+space.
Definitely a cool hobby
17/08/2025, 11:09 - +44 7516 029853: As if it's something bad. Lego was my favourite toy, and many of my female friends loved Lego too.
17/08/2025, 11:10 - +44 7446 051842: I guess it shows appreciation for things that we are ungrateful for, but if they are hellbent on buying new astronomical tools to see the moon in greater detail, I think it would get a boring for me. It’s a cool party trick but it’d wear off. <This message was edited>
17/08/2025, 11:11 - +44 7446 051842: Singing, musical instruments, reading, learning foreign languages, travelling. 
Those never get old.
17/08/2025, 11:12 - +44 7516 029853: The sky tends to change lol  
Thus endless opportunities to use the telescope
17/08/2025, 11:13 - +44 7446 051842: Sculpting in stone seems sort of attractive for a bloke, but I think that’s because it requires strong discipline.
17/08/2025, 11:13 - +44 7446 051842: Painting is universally attractive.
17/08/2025, 11:13 - +44 7446 051842: Most expressive art is.
17/08/2025, 11:14 - +44 7516 029853: "Paint me like one of your French girls" yeah 

Though I personally don't fancy it much
17/08/2025, 11:15 - +44 7446 051842: If they can express an original idea well it is great.
17/08/2025, 11:34 - onur: For me being interested in art is attractive
17/08/2025, 11:35 - onur: I cant really say producing art because some of those who produce art are really not into art :D
17/08/2025, 11:35 - onur: I would like to be able to discuss the history and philosophise etc
17/08/2025, 11:36 - onur: U need to consume a lot of different art to talk about it so an artist wouldnt be able to consume as much I guess since they are busy :D
17/08/2025, 11:36 - onur: But I still feel distanced to the idea of a hobby being attractive
17/08/2025, 11:37 - onur: I have never ever thought oh this girls hobby is this its very attractive :D

17/08/2025, 12:59 - +44 7446 051842: Interesting.
17/08/2025, 12:59 - +44 7446 051842: We are right though.

25-30% of those who were 20 in 1960 would go on to develop them by 40.

In 1980 this percentage was 30-35%.

In 2000 this percentage was 40-45%.

So it's not so simple....

I won't elaborate.

There must be some measure for how quickly that becomes apparent though
19/08/2025, 11:30 - +44 7599 430972: Yeah none of these hobbies have descriptive of predictive power over personality/compatibility or character. It’s a social uniqueness signalling for others
19/08/2025, 11:30 - +44 7599 430972: Performative male I believe it’s called
19/08/2025, 11:31 - +44 7516 029853: That's exactly why it's so valuable today. He needs to have ot as a hobby, meaning - deliberately choosing

19/08/2025, 11:34 - +44 7599 430972: Reading is a very vague hobby: reading hate threads on reddit, reading classical philosophy, young adult fiction or books about feminism?
19/08/2025, 11:35 - +44 7516 029853: Not reading is definitely scary

24/08/2025, 09:20 - +44 7958 612614: mind you, I haven’t got a clue what kind of tuna this is...
24/08/2025, 10:00 - +44 7516 029853: My bestie ChatGPT said it's not even tuna:
"That fish is not a tuna.

From its body shape and features, it looks much more like an amberjack, most likely the greater amberjack (Seriola dumerili).

Key points:

Amberjacks have a long, streamlined body similar to tuna, but the head is more elongated and the mouth shape different.

They usually have a darker line running from the nose through the eye, which is faintly visible here.

The dorsal fin is less prominent compared to tunas.

The tail is strongly forked, but the body isn’t as deep and muscular as a tuna.


So: It’s not tuna, it’s an amberjack (a jack species, family Carangidae).
---
🔹 Body shape

Amberjack – Long and somewhat cylindrical, but slimmer than tuna. Head is longer and a bit pointier.

Tuna – Deeper, rounder body, more muscular (torpedo-shaped).
---
🔹 Fins

Amberjack – Dorsal fin is continuous but not very tall. Pectoral fins are fairly long.

Tuna – After the second dorsal fin and anal fin, tunas have a line of small finlets (yellowfin, bluefin etc.) leading to the tail – amberjacks do not have these.
---
🔹 Colour & markings

Amberjack – Usually silver-grey with a darker stripe running from nose through the eye to the dorsal fin.

Tuna – Varies by species, but generally metallic blue on top, silvery below; yellowfin has bright yellow fins, bluefin has very deep body.
---
🔹 Tail

Both have a deeply forked tail, but tuna’s is usually more crescent-shaped and reinforced with keels at the tail base (little ridges on each side). Amberjack lacks the strong keels.

---
🔹 Behaviour / habitat

Amberjack – Often caught around wrecks, reefs, or offshore structures.

Tuna – More open-ocean, pelagic, and much faster swimmers.
---

✅ Quick tip:
If you see finlets behind the dorsal/anal fins → tuna.
If you see a dark stripe through the eye, no finlets → amberjack. " <This message was edited>

24/08/2025, 15:10 - Will-hazzer777: I'm not saying I agree with either stance... I haven't given it enough thought.... 

However what I would point out as a discrepancy is that many people's attitudes towards the dead and dead bodies are inconsistent. 

I get the strong whiff of contradiction when it comes to these people's attitudes towards the bodies of the recently departed and those from the past, and the remains of those attached to Western civilization in comparison to those from other civilizations.
24/08/2025, 16:53 - +44 7516 029853: It's an excellent question. 
I remember discussing this with my friend, as she had a very well-structured and informed opinion on the topic. Unfortunately, since I haven't been thinking about human remains for a while, I forgot many facts about the ethics of the matter 🥲. 

I need a refresher from her. Maybe I will be back later
24/08/2025, 16:59 - +353 89 605 0161: My first proper job interview I ended up talking about human remains.
I can't imagine how desperate they must have been because everything about me screamed serial killer...

I had blood on my shirt collar (I'd gotten a haircut just before and when they shaved the back of my neck they held the blade 90° and just shredded me) and it has really a hot summer, and I rushed through London in a suit so I was pretty sweaty tbh.
I didn't realise this until I saw myself in the mirror on the lift back down.

They asked what I did in my spare time (pre Covid interviews were such a doss) and I'd just watched the Robert Sapolsky TTC series, the lecture "Why we want the bodies back" so I told them about that 🤷‍♂
24/08/2025, 17:49 - +44 7516 029853: They were capable of seeing you as a decent human being even despite the blood on your shirt (pre-Covid, some people had communication skills, some say).

24/08/2025, 20:35 - +44 7516 029853: This is the thing. Where "good" is debatable, because they can be good for their peers, indeed, I want to go back to the word "decent".
According to 2 dictionaries, the definition of decent is:
a. Cambridge dictionary
1. socially acceptable or good
2. acceptable, satisfactory, or reasonable
b. Merriam-Webster dictionary, 
1. as in nice
conforming to a high standard of morality or virtue
2. as in honorable
following the accepted rules of moral conduct
3. as in proper
following the established traditions of refined society and good taste"

Being a serial killer, (un)fortunately, does not fit any of these descriptions. <This message was edited>
24/08/2025, 20:38 - +44 7958 612614: if you serially kill a certain type of people - within a society that dislikes those people it would be considered good and acceptable.    Example - wars.  
Honourable - honour killings?
I’m sure that all sort of unacceptable behaviours now were considered a good taste in Nazi Germany, for example..
24/08/2025, 20:40 - +44 7516 029853: "Serial killer" has a very specific meaning, which in wars is not used.
24/08/2025, 20:40 - +44 7958 612614: I wouldn’t be surprised that there are some twisted religious weirdos that think that killing prostitutes is OK
24/08/2025, 20:40 - +44 7958 612614: I meant - in time of wars
24/08/2025, 20:41 - +44 7958 612614: and those weirdos have their own in-groups where it’s socially acceptable to be such
24/08/2025, 20:41 - +44 7958 612614: like incels

25/08/2025, 11:43 - +44 7516 029853: I tried watching "Lucy", but gave up after 5 mins and watched a stand-up instead 🙃

25/08/2025, 11:51 - Will-hazzer777: Beautiful people
25/08/2025, 11:51 - Will-hazzer777: What about the pride flag?
25/08/2025, 11:53 - +44 7958 612614: a stand-up comedy?  Have you tried watching D&D on youtube - like Critical Roll? <This message was edited>
25/08/2025, 11:55 - +44 7958 612614: lol, where did you see people?
25/08/2025, 12:05 - +44 7599 430972: Name your favourite women stand up comedians
25/08/2025, 12:07 - +44 7516 029853: Not yet, but I feel like it will happen at some point.
25/08/2025, 12:08 - +44 7516 029853: Is it a philosophical question, or do you want to pick a fight? ☺️
25/08/2025, 12:09 - +44 7599 430972: Nah just want you to name your favourite standup comedians
25/08/2025, 12:14 - +44 7516 029853: I like recent Jimmy Carr's specials (early ones not so much), as well as Kevin Bridges and Jim Jefferies. 
Sarah Silverman's Netflix special "Postmortem" was good, though I don't like that much her early work.
25/08/2025, 12:15 - +44 7958 612614: For what’s it worth - cannot stand Silverman.  Totally unfunny
25/08/2025, 12:16 - +44 7516 029853: Have you watched Postmortem?
25/08/2025, 12:16 - +44 7958 612614: no
25/08/2025, 12:16 - +44 7516 029853: That is exactly what I am saying. Not a fan, but that show is good
25/08/2025, 12:22 - +353 89 605 0161: Listened to Dungeons and Daddies?
First season was funny I thought. Very American and can be a bit grating after a while but fun.
25/08/2025, 12:25 - +44 7599 430972: Brits are the only people I know that would describe something as “american” meaning a quality adjective
25/08/2025, 12:27 - +353 89 605 0161: Not this brit
25/08/2025, 12:29 - +44 7599 430972: I didn’t say high quality
25/08/2025, 12:30 - +44 7599 430972: But generally it’s peculiar to me that Brits think other people a) care that something is american b) assign any additional qualifications to an “american” adjective
25/08/2025, 12:30 - +44 7599 430972: Some unprocessed trauma maybe
25/08/2025, 12:34 - +353 89 605 0161: I don't mean it as quality I mean it has a description of the type of references and jokes it makes.

I.e. One of the characters backgrounds was an American football player jock type, now an out of shape middle aged dad.
That, to me, is a pretty American trope.
If the show was set in UK, that character would probably have been a promising football player who didn't make the cut due to a knee injury, which I think is the closest parallel but different enough.
25/08/2025, 12:35 - +353 89 605 0161: That ain't unique to Brits in the slightest 😅
25/08/2025, 12:36 - +44 7599 430972: Isn’t it? I can recommend you you a very Polish show and a very Ghanan sitcom
25/08/2025, 12:37 - +44 7599 430972: I also never seen Americans describing media as “very british” - quite unilateral relationship
25/08/2025, 12:37 - +353 89 605 0161: ... That's just complete bollocks
25/08/2025, 12:37 - +44 7599 430972: Also in the example you gave it’s codified as a same trope
25/08/2025, 12:37 - +44 7599 430972: narcissism of minor differences
25/08/2025, 12:39 - +353 89 605 0161: Feel free. But if you say a show is very Polish, I haven't seen any Polish shows so it won't mean anything to me, whether or not it's an accurate description.
25/08/2025, 12:41 - +44 7599 430972: It’s peculiar how inferiority complex alters even subconscious behaviour. A ex colony is not just a place now but a cultural simulacrum
25/08/2025, 12:41 - +353 89 605 0161: Where's the inferiority?
25/08/2025, 12:42 - +353 89 605 0161: Recognising a difference is inferiority?
25/08/2025, 12:42 - +44 7958 612614: you see how triggered you are 🤣🤣. That’s the proof!
25/08/2025, 12:42 - +44 7599 430972: Mostly in unilaterality
25/08/2025, 12:42 - +353 89 605 0161: Your anti brit bits are usually funny <This message was edited>
25/08/2025, 12:42 - +44 7599 430972: Also this yes
25/08/2025, 12:42 - +353 89 605 0161: Alex S doesn't usually come for me so I'm all rattled 😅
25/08/2025, 12:44 - +44 7958 612614: he never comes after anyone - it’s your own guilty consciences
25/08/2025, 12:44 - +44 7958 612614: you need some shadow work to uncover the trauma
25/08/2025, 12:44 - +44 7599 430972: But it’s an obvious case of a culture fetishisation. No one calls anime “a very japanese” animation. “Very” particle implies there is a continuous quality to media which can range it from being a little bit american to a “very american”, it’s not just binary whether this show about american specific culture or not
25/08/2025, 12:45 - +353 89 605 0161: I don't feel traumatised, is that another symptom of trauma?
25/08/2025, 12:45 - +44 7958 612614: Bang! that’s it
25/08/2025, 12:45 - +44 7599 430972: Yeah I am just observing interesting language
25/08/2025, 12:45 - +44 7958 612614: self-denial
25/08/2025, 12:45 - +44 7599 430972: I never heard someone describe someting as “very moldovanian” for example
25/08/2025, 12:45 - +353 89 605 0161: I wonder why
25/08/2025, 12:45 - +44 7599 430972: And if I were to imagine why would someone use this grammatic concept
25/08/2025, 12:46 - +44 7516 029853: nah, they aren't the only people doing that, but perhaps, the only ones who can have some  cultural significance to do so. 
Brits not only have a distinguished culture (English Breakfast, Tesco, Buckfast etc), but well-known in the rest of the world for broadcasting, arts and culture scene <This message was edited>
25/08/2025, 12:46 - +44 7599 430972: It’s usually nationalistic pride
25/08/2025, 12:46 - +44 7599 430972: well-known, lol
25/08/2025, 12:46 - +44 7958 612614: I only have a nationalistic shame 🙁
25/08/2025, 12:46 - +44 7599 430972: I don’t have nationalistic affiliation
25/08/2025, 12:46 - +44 7516 029853: Have you ever heard of BBC before moving to the UK?
25/08/2025, 12:47 - +44 7599 430972: Yes but I wouldn’t associate television with Uk
25/08/2025, 12:47 - +44 7516 029853: you should <This message was edited>
25/08/2025, 12:47 - +44 7599 430972: There is no should
25/08/2025, 12:47 - +44 7599 430972: I’m just reflecting on cultural memes
25/08/2025, 12:48 - +44 7958 612614: POLL:

25/08/2025, 12:48 - +44 7599 430972: These narcissistic impromptu are the same across countries
25/08/2025, 12:48 - +353 89 605 0161: Anyway, Martin if you liked Critical role, you may also like dungeons and daddies 👍
And if you didn't like critical role, you still may like dungeons and daddies 🤷‍♂
25/08/2025, 12:48 - +44 7599 430972: Go to Russia they will tell you they invented both tv and radio
25/08/2025, 12:49 - +44 7599 430972: It’s boring and trivial
25/08/2025, 12:49 - +44 7599 430972: It’s just curious how own insecurities still shine through the facade
25/08/2025, 12:49 - +44 7599 430972: That’s all
25/08/2025, 12:49 - +44 7958 612614: <Media omitted>
25/08/2025, 12:49 - +44 7958 612614: My daughter @ holiday near Marseille - forest fires, presumably
25/08/2025, 12:50 - +44 7958 612614: <Media omitted>
25/08/2025, 12:51 - +44 7958 612614: thanks, some of the Critical Role episodes were great and some not so much - I’m looking forward to watching dungeons and daddies.  D&D is amazing as a concept
25/08/2025, 12:52 - +44 7599 430972: I find it’s good in some things
25/08/2025, 12:53 - +44 7599 430972: But surprisingly restrictive
25/08/2025, 12:53 - +44 7958 612614: but there are no inherent restrictions - you could re-design the rules
25/08/2025, 12:53 - +353 89 605 0161: Homebrew baby
25/08/2025, 12:54 - +44 7599 430972: Yeah it’s not about the rules
25/08/2025, 12:54 - +44 7599 430972: There is a phenomenon I observed
25/08/2025, 12:54 - +44 7599 430972: After you watch it for some time the party merges into a singular entity and looses character
25/08/2025, 12:55 - +44 7599 430972: I think it’s because humans and their behaviour is actually quite boring to watch, they lack insanity and one-dimensionality fiction characters have
25/08/2025, 12:55 - +44 7958 612614: I’ve identified several subcultures that make a place more civilised - people commuting on rollerblades or swimming to work, widespread D&D and old ladies sunbathing topless
25/08/2025, 12:55 - +44 7958 612614: that should go towards happiness index and replace GDP as the measure
25/08/2025, 12:55 - +44 7599 430972: How about joggers?
25/08/2025, 12:55 - +44 7958 612614: sorry
25/08/2025, 12:55 - +44 7599 430972: They increase property prices <This message was edited>

25/08/2025, 12:56 - +44 7958 612614: free cultural events
25/08/2025, 12:56 - +44 7958 612614: free booze @ cultural events
25/08/2025, 12:56 - +44 7958 612614: people showing curiosity for other people by looking them in the eye and making an attempt to smile
25/08/2025, 12:56 - onur: Ahhahaha
25/08/2025, 12:57 - +353 89 605 0161: All the DnD shows have a lot more structure than they let on in the shows for sure.
And the DnD games I've played probably would be pretty boring viewing, even if everyone at the table is in stitches <This message was edited>
25/08/2025, 12:57 - +44 7958 612614: you need to get up to the frequency of the table, then it becomes the flow
25/08/2025, 12:58 - +44 7599 430972: But also people playing the character know they are _playing_, so the way their character behaves is different to as if this character was _living_ inside such universe
25/08/2025, 12:58 - +44 7516 029853: Do you ever smile or laugh? 
So much _тлен_ ☹️
25/08/2025, 12:58 - onur: In turkish it is used a lot !! You could say it was such a polish show etc or such an arabic behaviour ;D
25/08/2025, 12:58 - +44 7599 430972: Yea, while I was cycling and listening to Gracie Adams this morning
25/08/2025, 12:59 - +44 7958 612614: i’ve been experimenting with smiles - I’m writing a piece on it, but what’s really interesting is that you only have a milisecond
25/08/2025, 12:59 - +44 7958 612614: and if you don’t react quickly enough - the opportunity for reciprocation is gone
25/08/2025, 12:59 - +44 7958 612614: fabulously interesting - the moment someone catches your eye - you must make a very quick attempt at half smile
25/08/2025, 12:59 - +44 7599 430972: really? It would be bizzare to say it in Belarus for example
25/08/2025, 13:00 - +44 7599 430972: And we share a border!
25/08/2025, 13:00 - +44 7958 612614: and usually you get it back - it’s like channels of communication have been opened
25/08/2025, 13:00 - +44 7516 029853: We say "very Italian" in Moldova.
25/08/2025, 13:00 - +44 7958 612614: I do it very easily with certain type of people - they are incredibly intuitive - they can guess your smile before you actually do it
25/08/2025, 13:00 - +44 7599 430972: Well, maybe it’s just a language thing and I’m wrong
25/08/2025, 13:00 - onur: I mean not poland specifically since not a lot of polish influence in turkey but I would say for almost every context there is a racial/ ethnic equivalent
25/08/2025, 13:01 - onur: Like animals
25/08/2025, 13:01 - onur: Free as a bird, or sinister as a fox etc
25/08/2025, 13:01 - onur: Kind of thing
25/08/2025, 13:01 - onur: :D
25/08/2025, 13:01 - +44 7599 430972: hmmm I think of more as quality measure
25/08/2025, 13:02 - +44 7599 430972: Like you can say french dress, can you say “very french dress”
25/08/2025, 13:02 - +44 7516 029853: Of course, you are wrong, but it sparked a conversation. So well done, I guess
25/08/2025, 13:02 - onur: But if you have some polish folks around after some time when u see a certain behaviour that has been exercised by them you would say you are such a polish
25/08/2025, 13:02 - onur: Yeah
25/08/2025, 13:02 - onur: In turkish yeah
25/08/2025, 13:02 - +44 7599 430972: what would it mean
25/08/2025, 13:03 - onur: Very french?
25/08/2025, 13:03 - +44 7599 430972: yes
25/08/2025, 13:03 - onur: It would mean you are unaware of the situation
25/08/2025, 13:03 - +44 7599 430972: As opposed to just french
25/08/2025, 13:03 - +44 7516 029853: Having distinctive characteristics of a particular culture
25/08/2025, 13:03 - +44 7516 029853: Not just some elements, but many elements
25/08/2025, 13:03 - +44 7599 430972: I would argue this is just “american show”
25/08/2025, 13:03 - onur: Hmm it wont change the meaning compeltely, you would just increasing the intensity of being a french in that situation
25/08/2025, 13:03 - +44 7599 430972: “very american show” means something different
25/08/2025, 13:03 - +44 7958 612614: so this would be a french key
25/08/2025, 13:03 - +44 7958 612614: <Media omitted>
25/08/2025, 13:04 - +44 7599 430972: very french key?
25/08/2025, 13:04 - +44 7599 430972: I think it’s a spanner
25/08/2025, 13:04 - +44 7516 029853: With a beret
25/08/2025, 13:04 - +44 7516 029853: and a baguette
25/08/2025, 13:04 - +44 7599 430972: Like I would argue if I heard that someone is “very french” it would mean they’re annoying
25/08/2025, 13:05 - +44 7958 612614: this one is a very french key
25/08/2025, 13:05 - onur: Maybe when u add “very” its like too much
25/08/2025, 13:05 - +44 7958 612614: <Media omitted>
25/08/2025, 13:05 - onur: Yeah I guess
25/08/2025, 13:05 - +44 7599 430972: I think you’re onto something
25/08/2025, 13:05 - onur: Leaking all over the place
25/08/2025, 13:05 - +44 7958 612614: Very French cheese would probably be marginally stinkier than merely a French cheese
25/08/2025, 13:06 - onur: I would imagine they are smoking too much or they are hairy ;D
25/08/2025, 13:06 - onur: Btw
25/08/2025, 13:06 - onur: Not annoying
25/08/2025, 13:06 - +44 7599 430972: So negative characteristics?
25/08/2025, 13:06 - onur: But in turkish calling someone french means they are not aware of the situation
25/08/2025, 13:06 - +44 7958 612614: oh, and your OCD kicks in at this moment and whispers into your ear “they probably don’t wash”
25/08/2025, 13:07 - +44 7599 430972: no probabilities there
25/08/2025, 13:07 - onur: Probably, most of these racial and ethnic uses are negative
25/08/2025, 13:07 - +44 7599 430972: Ok so then
25/08/2025, 13:07 - +44 7599 430972: What does “very british” means?
25/08/2025, 13:07 - +353 89 605 0161: Aloof or can't read the room?
25/08/2025, 13:07 - onur: Probably ;D
25/08/2025, 13:08 - onur: For me “very indirect”
25/08/2025, 13:08 - onur: Like hiding true intensions
25/08/2025, 13:08 - onur: :D
25/08/2025, 13:08 - +44 7599 430972: And a “very British show”?
25/08/2025, 13:08 - onur: Using british humour elements a lot like deadpan
25/08/2025, 13:09 - +44 7958 612614: Lol, once you are comfortable around Brits, your non-Britishness becomes a very powerful trait.  You can still play their game while playing your own game on the outskirts
25/08/2025, 13:09 - +44 7958 612614: you can out-play Brits at being British
25/08/2025, 13:09 - onur: I like games only in pc
25/08/2025, 13:09 - onur: :D
25/08/2025, 13:09 - +44 7958 612614: feigning outrage when they try to aim questions slightly more directly
25/08/2025, 13:09 - +44 7599 430972: Yeah I would say vulgar and cringe
25/08/2025, 13:10 - +44 7599 430972: Like Inbetweeners <This message was edited>
25/08/2025, 13:10 - +353 89 605 0161: Weirdly, that was quite popular internationally.
25/08/2025, 13:10 - +353 89 605 0161: Even though it was shit
25/08/2025, 13:10 - +44 7599 430972: But that’s idiosyncratic I’d argue
25/08/2025, 13:10 - +44 7599 430972: All of us have different perceptions of what “very british” means
25/08/2025, 13:11 - onur: The last british show I watched was humans
25/08/2025, 13:11 - +44 7599 430972: “very american” is systematic
25/08/2025, 13:11 - onur: Its also subjective
25/08/2025, 13:11 - +44 7958 612614: I’d like to develop some universal vocabulary around declaring conversation bland and meaningless, sort of - not worth wasting time on
25/08/2025, 13:11 - +44 7958 612614: I use “protocol-laden” a lot to indicate my displeasure
25/08/2025, 13:12 - onur: If u ask turkish people theyd say americans are like cunning people :D <This message was edited>
25/08/2025, 13:12 - +353 89 605 0161: Small talk?
25/08/2025, 13:12 - onur: Or if you go somewhere else theyd say american = fat or stupid
25/08/2025, 13:13 - +44 7958 612614: no, just normatively restricted - basically taking way too much time and going through stages of politeness and measured back and forth-ness
25/08/2025, 13:13 - +44 7516 029853: Monty Python 

or "Withnail and I" as an example of a very British movie/book
25/08/2025, 13:13 - +44 7958 612614: withnail and I is my favourite british film
25/08/2025, 13:13 - +44 7516 029853: mine too !

25/08/2025, 13:15 - +44 7516 029853: but it required a very high level of English language proficiency

it is funny in translation, but not even close to its original humour
25/08/2025, 13:15 - +44 7516 029853: which is very British <This message was edited>
25/08/2025, 13:15 - +44 7958 612614: anyway, his stories are just incredible...
25/08/2025, 13:15 - +44 7958 612614: One of those rare people I’d really like to have a drink with
25/08/2025, 13:20 - +44 7516 029853: When I rarely want to be rude and not to be seen as one (I prefer to be openly rude), I do the reverse code switching, blaming my attitude on either not being born in that culture or even saying it was a language barrier
25/08/2025, 13:23 - +44 7958 612614: you don’t strike me as a rude person
25/08/2025, 13:24 - +44 7516 029853: I will take it!
25/08/2025, 13:25 - +44 7599 430972: What’s everyone’s opinion on Oasis?
25/08/2025, 13:25 - +44 7516 029853: nooooooo
25/08/2025, 13:25 - +44 7958 612614: but with rude people - they are either ineffectively rude - you despise them or they are masterfully rude - you admire them
25/08/2025, 13:25 - +44 7958 612614: there aren’t many masterfully rude people around 🙁
25/08/2025, 13:26 - onur: Always a banger when wonderwall is in the set in the raves ;D
25/08/2025, 13:26 - +353 89 605 0161: "A gentleman is someone who is never rude, except on purpose. "
25/08/2025, 13:26 - +44 7516 029853: I am currently in Dublin, and the whole city was celebrating their arrival, as if it were NYE. It felt so lonely as I wanted to be part of the communal celebration, but I could not 😟
25/08/2025, 13:26 - +44 7958 612614: one band that I truly hate is Coldplay 🤮🤮
25/08/2025, 13:27 - +44 7958 612614: are you a spy?
25/08/2025, 13:27 - +44 7958 612614: I mean, a silly quesiton - you’ll deny it
25/08/2025, 13:27 - +44 7516 029853: I wish!
25/08/2025, 13:27 - +44 7958 612614: or playfully acknowledge
25/08/2025, 13:27 - +44 7958 612614: 🙁
25/08/2025, 13:27 - +44 7958 612614: you can’t win with spies...
25/08/2025, 13:28 - +44 7516 029853: But I was asked that question too many times. I think I should be at least given the opportunity to work for them
25/08/2025, 13:29 - +44 7958 612614: the rule is - if you think someone might be a spy - the are probably not
25/08/2025, 13:29 - +44 7958 612614: the only people who might be spies and look like one are the ones who are already successful elsewhere and quite flamboyant - then you give them benefit  of doubt
25/08/2025, 13:30 - +44 7958 612614: famous actors, musicians, authors, poets, philosophers - they could be spies despite the fact they may look / behave like spies
25/08/2025, 13:30 - +44 7516 029853: I think it is the opposite. They should blend well, be unnoticeable. Only James Bond and other rare exceptions can be quite flamboyant
25/08/2025, 13:31 - +44 7958 612614: normal spies, yes, but bigger than life people are already bigger than life
25/08/2025, 13:49 - +44 7599 430972: Yes, sometimes they're cheekily ask other whether they are spies to divert attention
25/08/2025, 13:57 - +353 89 605 0161: It's the impenetrable "I know you are, but what am I?" defense.
25/08/2025, 14:08 - +44 7958 612614: you’re such a cynic!

26/08/2025, 00:05 - +44 7516 029853: So, today I tested the theory with a Norwegian person. 
The rhythm of our speech was quite different (he would occasionally pause), so I double checked if my assumption is correct, and it's due to Norwegian falling into the 3rd category. And it's correct
26/08/2025, 00:39 - Will-hazzer777: Well I think theres a hint of resemblance.

26/08/2025, 09:33 - +44 7516 029853: Interesting grammatical observation.
Double negation is rarely used in English (unless in some dialects, like the Southern American ones, where it acts like a negative expression). 
But in Ukrainian and russian it is widely used, as well as in Romanian (though in Romanian it might act unexpectedly, so you just need to know, but it's mostly used) <This message was edited>

26/08/2025, 09:45 - +44 7599 430972: I would say in this case it’s more southern american due to negated noun “need no man”, I think I got inspired by Nina Simone “Ain’t got no home, ain’t got no shoes”

27/08/2025, 12:46 - Will-hazzer777: Yeah but from Iraq
27/08/2025, 12:46 - onur: They are all the same ;D
27/08/2025, 12:46 - Ali: What would you do for me in return though?
27/08/2025, 12:46 - Will-hazzer777: Are Iraqis Turks now?
27/08/2025, 12:46 - Will-hazzer777: Same, same but different... But still same...
27/08/2025, 12:46 - onur: What do you need? :d
27/08/2025, 12:47 - onur: Kurds and arabs or smth
27/08/2025, 12:47 - +44 7958 612614: <Media omitted>
27/08/2025, 12:47 - Ali: Oh hello Martin… you’re looking great…
27/08/2025, 12:47 - Will-hazzer777: Really playing into the whole... "They're all the same" vibe...
27/08/2025, 12:47 - +44 7958 612614: I’m glad that someone appreciates it...
27/08/2025, 12:47 - Ali: A Turkish barber
27/08/2025, 12:48 - onur: (:
27/08/2025, 12:48 - +44 7599 430972: The Barber of Seville
27/08/2025, 12:48 - Will-hazzer777: Another time they were Pakistani I think...
27/08/2025, 12:49 - +44 7958 612614: you’re so gullible - didn’t it seem suspicious that the same barber changed nationality a week later?
27/08/2025, 12:49 - onur: I would like to joke and laugh as well but yeah :D i have an interview in 10 mins
27/08/2025, 12:49 - onur: He wishes he has that much hair
27/08/2025, 12:49 - +44 7958 612614: at least you get interviews ...
27/08/2025, 12:49 - +44 7958 612614: excuse me!  Body hair, I do!
27/08/2025, 12:49 - Ali: Good luck. Remember to make them feel good and add in a funny ;)
27/08/2025, 12:49 - onur: Yeah I guess thats a silver lining
27/08/2025, 12:49 - Will-hazzer777: Stop promoting foreign barbers... We have our own... Sweeney Todd: The demon barber of fleet Street
27/08/2025, 12:50 - onur: I am tired of performing its not me but yeah I am trying my best
27/08/2025, 12:50 - +44 7958 612614: work it, baby!
27/08/2025, 12:50 - Ali: Hot
27/08/2025, 12:50 - Will-hazzer777: The economy is looking really bad...
27/08/2025, 12:50 - Ali: It’s because he’s a minority…
27/08/2025, 12:50 - +44 7958 612614: oh, it’s more than that, but I won’t bore you with intelligent conversation…
27/08/2025, 12:51 - onur: Wtf lol
27/08/2025, 12:51 - +44 7958 612614: he’s a mainstream hipster
27/08/2025, 12:51 - onur: I need sponsorship
27/08/2025, 12:51 - onur: I lose like 95% of the job openings
27/08/2025, 12:51 - +44 7958 612614: join the Chippendales
27/08/2025, 12:51 - Will-hazzer777: https://www.ft.com/content/c8d6b705-55fb-47f6-a2fb-5b99c4a00dcd
27/08/2025, 12:51 - Ali: lol… DE&I darling. I’m in that category too.
27/08/2025, 12:51 - onur: I am not
27/08/2025, 12:52 - onur: :D
27/08/2025, 12:52 - +44 7958 612614: you?  as a straight female?
27/08/2025, 12:52 - onur: I choose white other and heterosexual and male
27/08/2025, 12:52 - Ali: In my industry yes
27/08/2025, 12:52 - +44 7958 612614: <Media omitted>
27/08/2025, 12:52 - +44 7958 612614: pray, say more - what’s your industry
27/08/2025, 12:52 - Ali: Oh interesting… it’s your name though init
27/08/2025, 12:53 - Will-hazzer777: That's the problem... Lots of my friends have ticked gay on the diversity monitoring form to help them secure work.
27/08/2025, 12:53 - onur: No my cv is good
27/08/2025, 12:53 - onur: Thats why i get interviews
27/08/2025, 12:53 - onur: But there is a lot of competition
27/08/2025, 12:53 - Will-hazzer777: That's not a lie
27/08/2025, 12:53 - +44 7958 612614: shit, never tried that !
27/08/2025, 12:53 - onur: And I am a secondary choice since needing sponsorship
27/08/2025, 12:53 - onur: (Extra cost)
27/08/2025, 12:53 - +44 7958 612614: you’re a secondary choice on so many levels...
27/08/2025, 12:54 - Ali: Gotta milk it for what it’s worth these days…
27/08/2025, 12:54 - onur: :’)
27/08/2025, 12:54 - +44 7958 612614: what you milk out of me won’t be milk ...
27/08/2025, 12:54 - Ali: Yum yum
27/08/2025, 12:54 - onur: Eww
27/08/2025, 12:55 - Will-hazzer777: That's why being LGBTQ is so high amongst gen Z ... It's not that so many more are actually LGBTQ, it's because the stats are all fucked because people believe it helps them secure work.
27/08/2025, 12:55 - Ali: <Media omitted>
27/08/2025, 12:55 - +44 7958 612614: I think the tide is turning (or has turned)
27/08/2025, 12:55 - Will-hazzer777: Not amongst the people doing the hiring...
27/08/2025, 12:55 - onur: I will seek asylum as a gay person maybe last choice
27/08/2025, 12:55 - +44 7958 612614: how would you know?
27/08/2025, 12:56 - +44 7958 612614: good luck with that - if anything, you’ll go to the back of the queue
27/08/2025, 12:56 - +44 7958 612614: it’s not 1990s anymore
27/08/2025, 12:56 - +44 7958 612614: gay is a garden variety now
27/08/2025, 12:56 - Will-hazzer777: You're thinking of the US of A... Last time I looked we live in the Yookay... <This message was edited>
27/08/2025, 12:57 - Ali: Yes. Gay, non binary, vegan, pan sexual (because you have a thing for pans), Muslim fleeing persecution. It’ll be fine dalin
27/08/2025, 12:57 - +44 7958 612614: we follow, always follow while wagging our tail
27/08/2025, 12:57 - Will-hazzer777: Being trans might help more
27/08/2025, 12:57 - +44 7958 612614: lol, pan sexual hahahahah
27/08/2025, 12:57 - Will-hazzer777: This time they're dragging their feet...
27/08/2025, 12:57 - onur: Pansexual imp
27/08/2025, 12:58 - +44 7958 612614: well, not sure - think harder…
27/08/2025, 12:58 - +44 7958 612614: you need to be a rare kind that would capture imagination
27/08/2025, 12:58 - Will-hazzer777: Furry?
27/08/2025, 12:58 - Will-hazzer777: Gay Muslim?
27/08/2025, 12:58 - Will-hazzer777: That's rare
27/08/2025, 12:58 - +44 7958 612614: I don’t know, I’m saying - we need to search for the new “gay”
27/08/2025, 12:58 - +44 7958 612614: come on, we can do it
27/08/2025, 12:59 - +44 7958 612614: men advocacy is a new darling, for example
27/08/2025, 12:59 - Will-hazzer777: Pokémon gotta catchem all
27/08/2025, 12:59 - +44 7958 612614: but we need to look more into the future
27/08/2025, 12:59 - +44 7958 612614: what’s next
27/08/2025, 12:59 - Ali: <Media omitted>
27/08/2025, 12:59 - Will-hazzer777: 😯
27/08/2025, 13:00 - Will-hazzer777: This is a bespoke gif!
27/08/2025, 13:00 - Will-hazzer777: How did you do that?
27/08/2025, 13:00 - Ali: Dunno. Shall we invent the next movement?
27/08/2025, 13:00 - Ali: Hold on a gif of choice and press edit
27/08/2025, 13:00 - Will-hazzer777: Thanks 👍
27/08/2025, 13:01 - Ali: I make them for bar mitzvah’s and weddings too.
27/08/2025, 13:08 - +44 7958 612614: saucy and sassy...
27/08/2025, 14:10 - +44 7516 029853: Facts. I went once and it turned out to be owned by Kurds. Though I was talkative and ended up getting a free haircut.
27/08/2025, 14:11 - +44 7516 029853: Why a Turkish barbershop instead of girly salons? Bcs I urgently needed a haircut and the salons said it is impossible, I need to have an *appointment* . Never coming back, my choice is pseudo-Turkish barbershops
27/08/2025, 14:11 - onur: <Media omitted>
27/08/2025, 14:12 - onur: Its disgusting. Idk how people feel comfortable covered in food
27/08/2025, 14:13 - onur: I would like to see them using KURDISH barbershop instead
27/08/2025, 14:13 - onur: Since they probably sought asylum saying they are MURDERING us in turkey just because we are kurds
27/08/2025, 14:14 - onur: 😅😜
27/08/2025, 14:14 - +353 89 605 0161: Kurds, Turks, Syrians.
Indistinguishable.
27/08/2025, 14:14 - +353 89 605 0161: You walk around in moth food all the time probably
27/08/2025, 14:14 - +353 89 605 0161: *moth larvae apparently
27/08/2025, 14:15 - onur: X2 disgusting
27/08/2025, 14:15 - onur: True ;d
27/08/2025, 14:15 - onur: Its because turkish is not an ethnicity
27/08/2025, 14:15 - onur: Its like a nationality like american <This message was edited>

27/08/2025, 14:16 - onur: All that tomato in your hair bro omg
27/08/2025, 14:16 - onur: Whats fun about it
27/08/2025, 14:16 - +353 89 605 0161: They scoop it all up at the end and put it in a giant paella
27/08/2025, 14:17 - onur: Water fight would be much better
27/08/2025, 14:17 - onur: And cleaner
27/08/2025, 14:17 - onur: And could use sea water
27/08/2025, 14:18 - onur: Im just feeling sad for those people who clean it
27/08/2025, 14:19 - Will-hazzer777: It's simple enough to call it a Kurdish barber... Why hide behind the Turks?... Like how the Bangladeshis hide behind the Indians.
27/08/2025, 14:19 - Will-hazzer777: You're never coming back to?
27/08/2025, 14:20 - +353 89 605 0161: Probs not that deep.
Just piggy backing on an already established business.
27/08/2025, 14:21 - +353 89 605 0161: For recognisability and trust.
27/08/2025, 14:21 - Will-hazzer777: What's not to trust about a Kurd or Bengali?
27/08/2025, 14:21 - onur: :D
27/08/2025, 14:21 - +353 89 605 0161: Read the first bit again
27/08/2025, 14:22 - Parag-meetup: It’s the company 
All the girls you play with 
It’s a sangria fest
27/08/2025, 14:22 - +353 89 605 0161: It's already established for Turkish barber and Indian food
27/08/2025, 14:22 - Will-hazzer777: Or for that matter what is there to trust in a Turk or Indian?
27/08/2025, 14:22 - onur: Nice one
27/08/2025, 14:22 - onur: Everything is better with company tho
27/08/2025, 14:22 - +353 89 605 0161: 2nd mover advantage
27/08/2025, 14:22 - onur: Almost
27/08/2025, 14:23 - Parag-meetup: And orgies
27/08/2025, 14:23 - onur: I wouldnt be able to get it up in an orgy
27/08/2025, 14:23 - onur: :D
27/08/2025, 14:23 - Will-hazzer777: Why didn't the Japanese and Thai say... Ohh the Chinese are well established... We might as well call our establishments Chinese restaurants.
27/08/2025, 14:24 - Parag-meetup: I understand Indian food , becasue it’s the cuisine itself 

I don’t understand Turkish barbers 
It’s such a replicable skill , how is it still dominated by one clout
27/08/2025, 14:24 - Parag-meetup: Ya cuisine makes sense
27/08/2025, 14:24 - onur: The mentality of the service is different
27/08/2025, 14:24 - onur: I guess
27/08/2025, 14:24 - Parag-meetup: Ya but that would be common to a lot of counties
27/08/2025, 14:25 - Parag-meetup: I think it’s a kinship thing , and using the previous fame to today’s advantage 
May be being a bit of protectionist
27/08/2025, 14:25 - onur: Idk, i went to a banglo, british and turkish barbers so far
27/08/2025, 14:30 - +44 7516 029853: Yeah. I asked that question too.
Turns out they just bought it from previous Turkish owners and did not want to spend extra time on new branding/paperwork
27/08/2025, 14:31 - onur: Sure xd
27/08/2025, 14:31 - onur: 95% of the kurds in here are fugitives
27/08/2025, 14:31 - Parag-meetup: Ya , but there could be new establishments 

I understand it used to work in yesteryears , when the skill was a carefully guarded property and only shared between your own community 

But now everything is so public , you can literally learn everhing off you tube
27/08/2025, 14:36 - +353 89 605 0161: It's the marketing though.
It doesn't matter that anyone could learn the skills.

People see Turkish barber and they have an image in mind of what it is so they go there.
They see kurdish barber and they don't make the same association.
Why would the owners bother building up a new brand if the current one is working and you can keep using it? <This message was edited>
27/08/2025, 14:49 - onur: <Media omitted>
27/08/2025, 14:50 - +44 7958 612614: you’re volunteeering too much information.  Don’t ask, don’t tell 😉
27/08/2025, 14:54 - +44 7958 612614: gazpacho is fun
27/08/2025, 14:55 - +44 7958 612614: OCD about clean comes to the fore again...
27/08/2025, 14:56 - +44 7958 612614: you can have homosexual orgies as well
27/08/2025, 15:01 - Will-hazzer777: On the run...
27/08/2025, 15:03 - Will-hazzer777: Like homosexually in the American military before Obama.
27/08/2025, 15:03 - +44 7516 029853: I am being bullied 😣
27/08/2025, 15:03 - Will-hazzer777: Who is bullying you?
27/08/2025, 15:04 - +44 7516 029853: Martin
27/08/2025, 15:04 - +44 7516 029853: does not let me talk
27/08/2025, 15:04 - Will-hazzer777: He's realised that he spends too much time on here taking in nonsense information...
27/08/2025, 15:05 - Will-hazzer777: Not sure where he expects to take in no nonsense however...
27/08/2025, 15:05 - Will-hazzer777: It's just about more or less .. not none.
27/08/2025, 15:08 - +44 7516 029853: I think the only reasonable decision we should make is to start bullying him, just so he knows. 
But I am not good at online bullying.
27/08/2025, 15:11 - +44 7516 029853: @⁨~Martin⁩ What are bald sea captains afraid of? Cap sizes
(source: https://www.wikihow.com/Bald-Jokes)
27/08/2025, 15:11 - +44 7516 029853: What’s truly pointless? To tell a bald guy a hair-raising story.
27/08/2025, 15:13 - +44 7958 612614: If you start bullying me - I’ll start believing that I’m worthy of bullying - my head will explode when the pressure of self-importance overcomes the strength of my scull 🙁. Do you REALLY want to kill me??
27/08/2025, 15:14 - +44 7958 612614: <Media omitted>
27/08/2025, 15:14 - +44 7958 612614: lol, I’m not even bald.
27/08/2025, 15:14 - +44 7958 612614: it’s all a marketing ploy
27/08/2025, 15:15 - onur: U teasing me? 3 replies in a row
27/08/2025, 15:16 - +44 7958 612614: Just trying to be helpful and positive.  If that’s a crime, I’m guilty 🙁
27/08/2025, 15:16 - onur: Its a crime in Crimea
27/08/2025, 15:16 - onur: They say
27/08/2025, 15:18 - onur: Why not
27/08/2025, 15:19 - +44 7516 029853: >  Do you REALLY want to kill me??

not kill, just tell me your biggest fears
27/08/2025, 15:19 - onur: What
27/08/2025, 15:19 - +44 7516 029853: we can do that too
27/08/2025, 15:20 - +44 7516 029853: so I could use it later
27/08/2025, 15:20 - onur: My biggest fear is keep being unemployed xD
27/08/2025, 15:20 - +44 7958 612614: you want to stick needles into my woodoo doll??
27/08/2025, 15:20 - +44 7516 029853: nah, cannot use it against you.
that would be cruel
27/08/2025, 15:20 - +44 7958 612614: my biggest fear is that i’ll lose my lush hair
27/08/2025, 15:21 - +44 7958 612614: and also - i’m scared I’ll get so rich that I’ll get depressed
27/08/2025, 15:21 - +44 7958 612614: see what you can do
27/08/2025, 15:21 - onur: My biggest weakness is I care too much
27/08/2025, 15:21 - onur: 🤣🤣
27/08/2025, 15:49 - +44 7516 029853: <Media omitted>
27/08/2025, 15:49 - Will-hazzer777: That's what happens... Rich people never know if their friends and lovers like them for them or their money... They live in a state of paranoia.
27/08/2025, 15:50 - Will-hazzer777: Only the poor know true love and friendship.
27/08/2025, 15:51 - Will-hazzer777: Also the misery rich people who people like nonetheless.
27/08/2025, 15:52 - +44 7958 612614: lol, actually I’m finishing an article about stupidity that I’ll be presenting in about an hour.  As I’m reading the source material , I’m trying to apply some ideas
27/08/2025, 15:52 - Will-hazzer777: And it's not because it's too hot....
27/08/2025, 15:52 - Will-hazzer777: What do you care about?
27/08/2025, 15:53 - +44 7516 029853: I have few incredibly rich friends and tbh, I simultaneously despise how delulu they are when it comes to money, on the other hand, it is truly inspiring
27/08/2025, 15:54 - Will-hazzer777: Yea, but they'll never be convinced that their friends and family actually like them for them... Unless they're miserly.
27/08/2025, 15:54 - +44 7958 612614: again, you haven’t got a clue - just speculating.  I don’t have a clue either, except that I don’t generalise and over-rationalise
27/08/2025, 15:54 - +44 7958 612614: where did you get that from??
27/08/2025, 15:55 - +44 7958 612614: rich people are just people with more digits in the balance of their bank accounts
27/08/2025, 15:55 - +44 7516 029853: nah
27/08/2025, 15:55 - +44 7516 029853: the world changes with wealth and/or physical beauty
27/08/2025, 15:56 - +44 7958 612614: I know (peersonally) at least 2 guys who are wealthy (made money in crypto) and still relatively young.  Both live in shared accommodation and hardly own any material stuff
27/08/2025, 15:56 - +44 7958 612614: you wouldn’t know they were rich
27/08/2025, 15:56 - +44 7958 612614: <Media omitted>
27/08/2025, 15:56 - +44 7958 612614: well, beauty hasn’t changed me
27/08/2025, 15:57 - Will-hazzer777: "They live in such a rarified place of the top 1% where there are very few people who share the realities of their world,” said the founding principal of Drayson Mews clinic, who shared that the super rich often cannot be fully certain if people like them for who they are, or for what they have."

It stands to reason.... But here's a source anyway...
27/08/2025, 15:57 - onur: It was a joke I was teasing with what Martin wrote
27/08/2025, 15:57 - onur: Well they are not alone
27/08/2025, 15:57 - +44 7958 612614: oh, you read an article about it.  Who needs life when you can find out everything in media.  Lol squared!
27/08/2025, 15:57 - onur: It is hard to feel understood
27/08/2025, 15:57 - +44 7958 612614: Especially when there’s nothing to understand...
27/08/2025, 15:58 - +44 7516 029853: I meant really wealthy (as I call them, hedgehog fund guys with 20 flats in Dubai), not random kids making a one-time profit from crypto.
27/08/2025, 15:58 - Will-hazzer777: I knew it already... I just went hunting for a source for your benefit.
27/08/2025, 15:58 - onur: Exactly ✍️
27/08/2025, 15:58 - +44 7958 612614: ok, you’re talking about rich assholes
27/08/2025, 15:59 - Will-hazzer777: Ultimately it's all relative though..
27/08/2025, 15:59 - +44 7958 612614: you don’t engage with life because you get prejudiced by what you read 3rd hand and assume it must be like that.  You really need to get in touch with @⁨onur⁩ to take you on a spiritual journey
27/08/2025, 16:00 - +44 7958 612614: down the kebab shop memory lane...

27/08/2025, 16:02 - Will-hazzer777: "What could possibly be challenging about being a billionaire, you might ask. Well, what would it be like if you couldn’t trust those close to you? Or if you looked at any new person in your life with deep suspicion? I hear this from my clients all the time: “What do they want from me?”; or “How are they going to manipulate me?”; or “They are probably only friends with me because of my money.”"

27/08/2025, 16:07 - onur: I mean its not really revealing
27/08/2025, 16:07 - +44 7958 612614: and what did I say?????
27/08/2025, 16:07 - +44 7958 612614: if we were to be more “scientific” - we could speculate as to what type of cheese it is..
27/08/2025, 16:07 - onur: I think its more like saying I have been working on water and I can confirm that its wet
27/08/2025, 16:07 - Ali: I’d be worried about everything else I’ve told him especially if I were already paranoid
27/08/2025, 16:07 - +44 7958 612614: Ok, you’re a genius as well.  Next...
27/08/2025, 16:08 - onur: I am worried about u
27/08/2025, 16:08 - +44 7958 612614: @⁨onur⁩  - shall I leave a positive review for you on LinkedIn?

27/08/2025, 16:09 - onur: Yeah but review on what
27/08/2025, 16:09 - onur: What exactly are you going to say
27/08/2025, 16:09 - +44 7958 612614: on your extraordinary capacities and capabilities.  I’ll just say - the guy’s a genius!

27/08/2025, 16:11 - +44 7958 612614: lol, why?
27/08/2025, 16:11 - onur: Its soft so would be more dense so = giant pull

27/08/2025, 16:12 - +44 7958 612614: soft is more dense?

27/08/2025, 16:20 - Ali: The one thing I love about these chats is how quickly the conversation flows. From being unemployed -> Turkish barbers —> cheese. It’s really impressive and I’d like to take a moment to really appreciate all of you and thank you all for such an entertaining time during a very difficult period. 

Kind regards and love to all xx
27/08/2025, 16:21 - +44 7958 612614: nothing like being appreciated
27/08/2025, 16:34 - Will-hazzer777: Like a well aged stilton.
27/08/2025, 17:31 - +44 7516 029853: My biggest fear is that slowly but surely I will become a "proper adult". I will lose my childlike curiosity, zest for life despite serious hardship, and will be too risk-averse and hopeless. 

I will leave you with that 🙃
27/08/2025, 17:48 - Will-hazzer777: When I am an old woman I shall wear purple,
With a red hat which doesn’t go, and doesn’t suit me.
And I shall spend my pension on brandy and summer gloves,
And satin sandals, and say we’ve no money for butter.

I shall sit down on the pavement when I’m tired,
And gobble up samples in shops and press alarm bells,
And run my stick along the public railings
And make up for the sobriety of my youth.

I shall go out in my slippers in the rain,
And pick flowers in other people’s gardens,
And learn to spit.

You can wear terrible shirts and grow more fat,
And eat three pounds of sausages at a go,
Or only bread and pickle for a week,
And hoard pens and pencils and beermats and things in boxes.

But now we must have clothes that keep us dry,
And pay our rent and not swear in the street,
And set a good example for the children.
We must have friends to dinner and read the papers.

But maybe I ought to practice a little now?
So people who know me are not too shocked and surprised,
When suddenly I am old, and start to wear purple.

27/08/2025, 17:50 - Will-hazzer777: And butter will be outlawed
27/08/2025, 17:51 - Will-hazzer777: So will sausages.
27/08/2025, 17:51 - Will-hazzer777: And brandy
27/08/2025, 17:52 - Will-hazzer777: I'm sure there will be some old beer mats floating about.... Just no beer or pubs.
27/08/2025, 17:53 - Will-hazzer777: And you might be able to just about wear purple... But you'll be covered from head to foot...
27/08/2025, 17:54 - Will-hazzer777: And sitting on the old and unmaintained pavements will be the only place to sit.

27/08/2025, 23:28 - onur: I never did such a thing
27/08/2025, 23:29 - +44 7516 029853: Why not? How else do you decide to leave romantic relationships?
28/08/2025, 00:01 - onur: :D
28/08/2025, 00:03 - onur: I got like 3-4 serious relationships and none of them ended after a logical deduction at least from my side
28/08/2025, 00:03 - onur: I mostly focus on how I feel when I am with that person
28/08/2025, 00:03 - onur: Rather then their actual qualities
28/08/2025, 00:03 - onur: It is more of a cumulative experience for me
28/08/2025, 00:03 - onur: i guess :D
28/08/2025, 00:04 - onur: Maybe its a man woman difference
28/08/2025, 00:04 - onur: I dont need someone to add something in my life I guess :D
28/08/2025, 00:08 - +44 7516 029853: That's a completely different discussion.
The pro/con list is a tool for decision-making. I can't say most of my friends use it, but it works well for me.
How am I supposed to know what I feel when it's unclear if I can't see the situation through a more logical perspective?
28/08/2025, 00:08 - onur: it depends on the genre of the relationship
28/08/2025, 00:08 - onur: if you love someone you love someone
28/08/2025, 00:08 - onur: if you don't u don't
28/08/2025, 00:09 - onur: it doesn't require a list to understand this
28/08/2025, 00:09 - onur: :D
28/08/2025, 00:09 - +44 7516 029853: facts

but the list is when you start thinking that it's time to go
28/08/2025, 00:10 - onur: maybe its a cope to soften the end of the relationship
28/08/2025, 00:11 - +44 7516 029853: there was never a winner in my case, though.

But the percentage is different 
(I calculate it too).
28/08/2025, 00:12 - +44 7516 029853: I guess.

however, it's quite normal to have conflicting feelings
28/08/2025, 00:12 - onur: my serious relationships ended with tears and a lot of emotions for some reason xD
28/08/2025, 00:12 - onur: yeah of course
28/08/2025, 00:13 - onur: I can see myself keeping a pros/ cons list if I am talking to 2 women and both are progressing
28/08/2025, 00:13 - onur: so I'll have to stop talking with one of them
28/08/2025, 00:13 - onur: to decide this maybe :D
28/08/2025, 00:13 - +44 7516 029853: I just compartmentalise people easily without a list
28/08/2025, 00:14 - +44 7516 029853: That's the easy part
28/08/2025, 00:14 - onur: hmm yeah similar
28/08/2025, 00:17 - +44 7516 029853: I mean not comparing people to each other. Each tends to be unique (though I always secretly know who my favourite is). But I do not make lists for that.
28/08/2025, 00:17 - +44 7516 029853: Lists are for serious situations when seeing numbers is essential
28/08/2025, 00:18 - onur: I had the opportunity to see the development of my fav over the years :D
28/08/2025, 00:18 - onur: she got older that's for sure lol

28/08/2025, 00:20 - onur: :D
28/08/2025, 00:21 - onur: my deduction is that we have a romanticised version of people in our heads
28/08/2025, 00:21 - onur: the reality is different
28/08/2025, 00:23 - onur: LSD made me realise we only know what we think others think of us

28/08/2025, 10:51 - +353 89 605 0161: Scores!?
How do you come up with a numerical value for qualitative aspects.
Being funny, 5 points.
On their phone too much, - 2 points.
28/08/2025, 11:08 - +44 7599 430972: Tall +100000000000000 points
28/08/2025, 11:24 - +44 7516 029853: Nah, tall is by default
28/08/2025, 11:25 - +44 7516 029853: It usually ranges from 1 to 10, but some qualities receive extra points. 
Super cute eyes + 15 points. 
Not laughing at my dumb jokes - 15 points.

Studies like this.
My suspicion was raised from anecdotal stuff. Friends of mine who are early years teachers, and their conversations with colleagues.
There's always people saying the latest generation is worse than ever(!) but I think teachers can also be the canary in the coal mine for these sorts of things. <This message was edited>
28/08/2025, 11:44 - +353 89 605 0161: And then for young adults and everyone else, studies showing just having your phone in the same room reduces concentration and performance etc...
And short form media/social media is what has people glued to the phone I think

29/08/2025, 09:59 - Will-hazzer777: It's not a bleed for more years..... Because women are going into the menopause earlier in life.

Starting their reproductive years earlier and finishing their reproductive years earlier.
29/08/2025, 10:00 - Will-hazzer777: It's probably partly to do with over nutrition.
29/08/2025, 10:03 - +44 7516 029853: Incorrect:
"Has the Age at Menopause Changed Over Time?

Global and Historical Trends

Norway (1936–1964 birth cohorts)
A large study of over 312,000 women found that the average age at menopause rose by nearly 3 years across generations:

Women born 1936–1939 reached menopause at around 50.3 years.

Women born 1960–1964 reached menopause at around 52.7 years.
Additionally, the interval between menarche (first period) and menopause increased by more than 3 years (from ~36.8 to ~40.2 years) .


United States (1959–2018 data)
The average age at natural menopause increased modestly:

1959–1962: ~48.4 years

2015–2018: ~49.9 years
The reproductive lifespan extended by about 2.1 years, partly due to the average age at menarche dropping from 13.5 to 12.7 years"

29/08/2025, 10:04 - +44 7516 029853: My people are bleeding for longer indeed.
29/08/2025, 10:05 - Will-hazzer777: "Higher intakes of energy (risk ratio (RR) = 3.32, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.74-6.34, I2 = 97%), and protein (RR = 3.15, 95% CI = 2.87-3.44, I2 = 0%) were associated with EMO risk. For each additional 1 g/day animal protein intake in childhood, the age at menarche was approximately two months earlier (β = -0.13, I2 = 55%), and high iron intake was associated with EMO (RR = 1.20, 95% CI = 1.03-1.40, I2 = 0%). Polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFAs) intake was associated with EMO risk with a dose-response effect (RR = 1.25, 95% CI = 1.05-1.49, I2 = 44%)."

29/08/2025, 10:06 - +44 7516 029853: Interesting!
29/08/2025, 10:09 - Will-hazzer777: Can't compare women who entered modernity in the middle of last century to women who are in modernity.

Essentially, women at the beginning of the last century entered menarche later and finished early because changes in nutrition across their life times.

Modern women have plenty of nutrients and start their menarche early and will finish early.

29/08/2025, 10:27 - +44 7516 029853: If I could choose a dictator from this chat, I would prefer @⁨onur⁩ . He would be overwhelmed quickly and we would build a democracy while he tries to figure out how to hate people properly. I am also not Armenian, so I would be safe.

29/08/2025, 10:47 - +44 7958 612614: @⁨onur⁩  and @⁨Will-hazzer777⁩  are so predictable - it's gonna be something about Turkey or hating foreigners
29/08/2025, 10:47 - +353 89 605 0161: I would pay more attention to a man with a sausage in his hand than a cup.
This guy is a political genius.
29/08/2025, 10:48 - onur: Is a pastry not sausage
29/08/2025, 10:48 - +353 89 605 0161: Oh, then I'm not interested

I went to a comedy show the other day, and they asked who wanted to be a judge to eliminate comedians. And I volunteered first. 
It was both nice to exercise power and crush people's dreams, but heartbreaking as well.
29/08/2025, 10:58 - +44 7958 612614: yep, all the heartbreaking done by you
29/08/2025, 10:59 - +353 89 605 0161: Rule number 1 for creating a dictator.
Don't accept the volunteers!
29/08/2025, 10:59 - +44 7958 612614: the problem is - most people can’t cut it as dictators.
29/08/2025, 11:00 - +44 7516 029853: We already have 2 male dictators, and no woman yet. 
Quite outdated, isn't it?
29/08/2025, 11:00 - +44 7958 612614: who’s the second male dictator?  William?

29/08/2025, 11:01 - +353 89 605 0161: What's the best thing about dictators?
Consistency?
The more absolute power?
29/08/2025, 11:02 - Will-hazzer777: Or anyone who wants the job.
29/08/2025, 11:02 - +44 7958 612614: well, if you’re a non self-actualised dictator - that will surely affect you psychologically.  You’ll have a pent-up unrealised authoritariasm
29/08/2025, 11:02 - +44 7958 612614: staying power
29/08/2025, 11:02 - +44 7958 612614: you must be able to outlast anything

29/08/2025, 21:34 - +44 7516 029853: One of the things I deeply dislike about the UK is its private rail. 
I still remember culture shock when I needed to register on 2 websites just to get 2 tickets, not even starting to talk about ticket prices.
@⁨onur⁩ fly there, it will be cheaper, especially with a layover somewhere in Europe
29/08/2025, 22:41 - onur: I checked it its not cheaper plus you have to pay about a similar amount to reach to the airport
29/08/2025, 22:41 - onur: 😅

30/08/2025, 21:06 - onur: :D
30/08/2025, 21:06 - onur: so offensive :D

30/08/2025, 21:15 - onur: I think :D
30/08/2025, 21:16 - Parag-meetup: Still not offensive
30/08/2025, 21:16 - Parag-meetup: Manhunt in Australian bush brings long-dismissed conspiracy theorists to the fore https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgyk7ry8rdo
30/08/2025, 21:17 - Parag-meetup: Found your new home @⁨Will-hazzer777⁩
30/08/2025, 21:28 - Will-hazzer777: It's clearly nonsense.

Whoever says they're a sovereign citizen is talking bollocks... 

All that matters is who has the ability to impose their will and those who don't.

It's all about timeframe anyway. Everyone has the ability to do a lot of things, it's whether or not any retaliation or retribution applies to you or not.

If it doesn't, then you can do it. You can still do it even if it does, so long as you don't mind the retribution or retaliation.
30/08/2025, 21:32 - Will-hazzer777: If you get caught parking your mobile home in a parking zone without a permit then you'll get a fine.... You might be happy to pay the fine or you might think that civilian law can't catch up with someone without a fixed address easily and decide not to pay any of the fines... Then you might be right in thinking that.
30/08/2025, 21:33 - Will-hazzer777: I have a friend who would get parking fines and was happy to pay them when he did because he spent a lot less in parking fines than he would have in parking tickets...
30/08/2025, 21:35 - Will-hazzer777: People have to think outside the box more.
30/08/2025, 21:35 - Will-hazzer777: All sounds rather boring tbh...
30/08/2025, 21:47 - +44 7958 612614: well, you’re wrong.  Putin and Trump and N. Korean bloke - they probably qualify for sovereign citizens
30/08/2025, 21:48 - Parag-meetup: But the tin hats match 
Bet their you tube history is also the same as yours
30/08/2025, 21:49 - +44 7958 612614: or any criminal who doesn’t give monkeys whether they are caught or killed - they are pretty sovereign
30/08/2025, 21:53 - +44 7958 612614: @⁨Will-hazzer777⁩ It's interesting that the super rich are still not doing much in terms of organising themselves into a formidable physical force.  I reckon that's coming next.  At the moment even Elon Musk is at risk of disappearing at the whim of the politicians.  If he were to setup a swarm of armed drones in multiple locations - that would create a serious problem for law enforcement.
30/08/2025, 21:54 - +44 7958 612614: now, if a number of super rich people communicated intention to co-ordinate their protection
30/08/2025, 21:55 - +44 7958 612614: so, I’d say that’s a very real next development that’s not thought of seriously
30/08/2025, 21:55 - +44 7958 612614: Elon Musk has recently been threatened with prison, exile…. When all of a sudden their personal safety becomes a concern - I think they’ll act on it.  It’s just another complex problem <This message was edited>
30/08/2025, 21:59 - Will-hazzer777: Not really.... As the article tries to articulate... That the concept of sovereign citizen rests upon "legal-sounding arguments that have no actual basis."

Putin etc.. authority doesn't rest upon legal sounding arguments.... They're based on real tangible personnel and manpower... I.e. armies and money...

The wordy justifications etc... don't hold water...
30/08/2025, 22:01 - Will-hazzer777: Doubt it... They're on the other end of the spectrum... They sound more like lefties who believe that things are justified based on words.
30/08/2025, 22:02 - Will-hazzer777: It's not that surprising
30/08/2025, 22:02 - +44 7958 612614: oh, maybe - but they have the real powers that so called “sovereign citizens” would like to have
30/08/2025, 22:03 - Will-hazzer777: That's ot what their argument is based on either way... Their argument is based on words.
30/08/2025, 22:05 - Will-hazzer777: By nature they're not cooperative people.
30/08/2025, 22:05 - +44 7958 612614: well, they think they can “opt out” of the legal system and societal obligations
30/08/2025, 22:06 - +44 7958 612614: and the autocrats - they “opt out” entire countries
30/08/2025, 22:06 - +44 7958 612614: so it’s similar
30/08/2025, 22:06 - +44 7958 612614: but on a different scale
30/08/2025, 22:06 - Will-hazzer777: They can do, but it has to based on deeds not words.
30/08/2025, 22:07 - +44 7958 612614: and they do it - if someone doesn’t pay for anything and doesn’t participate in the society and doesn’t obey laws - they are living it
30/08/2025, 22:07 - +44 7958 612614: not sure how many of them do it - but I’m sure that some manage
30/08/2025, 22:07 - +44 7958 612614: also, it’s natural that they’d still respect teh dynamics of power and try not to get into trouble with entities more powerful than them
30/08/2025, 22:08 - +44 7958 612614: just like old savage tribesmen wouldn’t confront an elephant or a lion bare-handed
30/08/2025, 22:09 - +44 7958 612614: so they are pursuing their sovereignty physically and offering their beliefs as a justification (to themselves and others)
30/08/2025, 22:09 - Will-hazzer777: However other people's rules don't have to apply to your able to stop any retaliation... And the best way to do that generally is to impose your own rules upon others.
30/08/2025, 22:10 - Will-hazzer777: Normies are typically compliant people... They go along with whoever has the biggest stick.
30/08/2025, 22:10 - +44 7958 612614: but like you said - sovereign citizens are loners - and without the abiltiy to collectivise - you cannot impose rules
30/08/2025, 22:12 - +44 7958 612614: Also, it’s interesting to see how will an alternative power arise in this current age of super surveillance and remote enforcement (drones).  Hisstory tells us that it always happens, but it will take some innovative strategy
30/08/2025, 22:12 - Will-hazzer777: You might just about be able to avoid the consequences of rules being imposed upon you but you but you have to be in a position where the rules don't apply to you.
30/08/2025, 22:12 - Will-hazzer777: Or can't be enforced
30/08/2025, 22:13 - +44 7958 612614: but nothing is immune to that - so it’s not a legalistic argument, more of a physical reality
30/08/2025, 22:13 - +44 7958 612614: physical impossibility
30/08/2025, 22:13 - Will-hazzer777: Well we're going to see balkanisation of many countries in the coming years.
30/08/2025, 22:13 - Will-hazzer777: As states find it more difficult to control their populations.
30/08/2025, 22:13 - Will-hazzer777: Especially multicultural societies.
30/08/2025, 22:14 - +44 7958 612614: I meant - big powers - small countries will be pushed into “alternatives” by opportunistic neo imperialism
30/08/2025, 22:14 - Will-hazzer777: They have already started loading on multiple fronts of non-compliance... Like with TV licenses.... Weed... Etc...
30/08/2025, 22:15 - Will-hazzer777: They don't have the means to enforce large scale non-compliance.
30/08/2025, 22:15 - +44 7958 612614: for example - how can any grassroots movement that wants to radically change the society take place?  They’d be obstructed to get to the point when someone might want to vote for them.  So democratic path is already not an option
30/08/2025, 22:15 - +44 7958 612614: no.
30/08/2025, 22:16 - +44 7958 612614: that’s simply the realisation of the state that it shouldn’t pursue trying to get people to comply with those
30/08/2025, 22:16 - Will-hazzer777: Even the ulez
30/08/2025, 22:16 - +44 7958 612614: just like China has more confidence in ascertaining if a certain citizen protest can be harmful for the system or not
30/08/2025, 22:16 - +44 7958 612614: and we perceive it as them getting softer
30/08/2025, 22:16 - +44 7958 612614: but that’s not true
30/08/2025, 22:17 - Will-hazzer777: There's loads of rules and laws people are increasingly flouting... E.g. shoplifting is so rampant that it isn't being stopped anymore.
30/08/2025, 22:17 - +44 7958 612614: no, again - NO.  Shoplifting is tollerated - the state passes on the cost of social liability onto the businesses
30/08/2025, 22:18 - Will-hazzer777: It's only tolerated because it's out of control.
30/08/2025, 22:18 - +44 7958 612614: just like the responsibility of policing illegal immigrants ahs been passed onto landlords, employers, etc...
30/08/2025, 22:19 - Will-hazzer777: That's clearly impossible... So they already do as they please... There's little stopping them already.
30/08/2025, 22:19 - +44 7958 612614: it’s a transitory step - when the state doesn’t want to become authoriatiran as long as it can help it - and it does it by trying to postpone the uprising
30/08/2025, 22:19 - +44 7958 612614: when the uprising comes
30/08/2025, 22:19 - +44 7958 612614: you’ll see what the state can do
30/08/2025, 22:19 - +44 7958 612614: nope, all this represents is - the state is trying to pit people against themselves so they don’t unite around the common enemy
30/08/2025, 22:20 - Will-hazzer777: Well they're clearly just losing control steadily... And it will get worse as we take the imf's bailout.
30/08/2025, 22:20 - +44 7958 612614: yes, losing control - until the moment when they can justify applying draconian force on people and removing your rights
30/08/2025, 22:20 - +44 7958 612614: which, of course, is coming
30/08/2025, 22:21 - +44 7958 612614: that’s the collapse that we’re all talking about
30/08/2025, 22:21 - +44 7958 612614: meta-crisis
30/08/2025, 22:21 - +44 7958 612614: this trend cannot be stopped, only postponed
30/08/2025, 22:21 - +44 7958 612614: you see what’s going on in the West?
30/08/2025, 22:22 - Will-hazzer777: They can't though... They don't have the man power...  That's why they're planning for a mass fatality situation.
30/08/2025, 22:22 - Will-hazzer777: They'll just try and mop up afterwards, which they won't be able to either.
30/08/2025, 22:23 - Will-hazzer777: There is a police recruitment crisis, just there is a army recruitment crisis. There's even a prison space crisis. <This message was edited>
30/08/2025, 22:24 - +44 7958 612614: You still live in the Middle Ages - you keep on talking about “man power”.  There are tools which are not in the possession of normal citizens but are with the police and the army - effective control of many people by few without direct confrontation is possible for the first time
30/08/2025, 22:24 - Will-hazzer777: It's actually being hastened by this government.
30/08/2025, 22:24 - +44 7958 612614: China does it through Social score
30/08/2025, 22:24 - +44 7958 612614: no, it only seems like it because you can’t see all that’s happening behind the scenes
30/08/2025, 22:25 - Will-hazzer777: There is barely a police force or an army? What are you talking about?
30/08/2025, 22:25 - +44 7958 612614: exactly, you don’t need any - just the AI and few operators
30/08/2025, 22:25 - Will-hazzer777: We've not even implemented half of their infrastructure to do any of that.
30/08/2025, 22:25 - +44 7958 612614: we will
30/08/2025, 22:25 - Will-hazzer777: There's no money to do it <This message was edited>
30/08/2025, 22:26 - +44 7958 612614: really?
30/08/2025, 22:26 - Will-hazzer777: Really
30/08/2025, 22:26 - +44 7958 612614: there was no money in china to do it either.  if anything they had less money
30/08/2025, 22:26 - +44 7958 612614: it’s only political will that matters
30/08/2025, 22:26 - Will-hazzer777: The Chinese have plenty of funds.
30/08/2025, 22:27 - Will-hazzer777: And they implemented it when they were rich.
30/08/2025, 22:27 - Will-hazzer777: It doesn't...
30/08/2025, 22:28 - Will-hazzer777: We don't even have a national NHS database... They couldn't even build HS2 without fucking that up.
30/08/2025, 22:28 - +44 7958 612614: is that because we don’t have money for the database?
30/08/2025, 22:29 - Will-hazzer777: When I was working in the police... Theres not national police database... Every police force has it's own... They don't share data easily or at all...
30/08/2025, 22:29 - +44 7958 612614: When I arrived here a week ago - I saw a lot more rubbish than abroad - maybe we don’t have money for rubbishmen?
30/08/2025, 22:30 - +44 7958 612614: that’s because they didn’t have money.  When they broke the piggy bank - it was pennies in it only
30/08/2025, 22:30 - Will-hazzer777: Everything is going one way and there's no easy way back.
30/08/2025, 22:30 - +44 7958 612614: you really just grab the easiest answer
30/08/2025, 22:30 - +44 7958 612614: and everything is hard or impossible - that’s just hte lack of imagination
30/08/2025, 22:31 - +44 7958 612614: and that’s why a single person in key position makes all the difference
30/08/2025, 22:31 - Will-hazzer777: Our national debt it is 100% of GDP. When labour left in 2010 the then minister for the treasury told us there was no money and he meant it. Since then we've been running the country solely of debt.
30/08/2025, 22:32 - Will-hazzer777: I'm not saying it's impossible... But highly improbable because our leaders and their minions have no imagination.
30/08/2025, 22:33 - Will-hazzer777: But we have none of note... It's not happening.
30/08/2025, 22:34 - Parag-meetup: You say debt 
I say confidence
30/08/2025, 22:34 - Will-hazzer777: That must be why your finances are the way they are.
30/08/2025, 22:35 - +44 7958 612614: yep, until it happens - it’s not happening.  Until it happens - it’s highly improbable - and then it happens
30/08/2025, 22:36 - Will-hazzer777: I can imagine maybe Farage bringing something like that in possibly... But it'll start by rounding up the illegals and migrants first.
30/08/2025, 22:37 - Parag-meetup: Did I miss a memo ?
30/08/2025, 22:37 - Parag-meetup: He would like to bring in more immigrants !
30/08/2025, 22:37 - Will-hazzer777: But the civil service will dig it's heels in and not do it... Even if they really want to... They won't because it'll be the wrong guy and the wrong motive.
30/08/2025, 22:37 - Parag-meetup: How else is he gonna get the next term
30/08/2025, 22:37 - Will-hazzer777: Legal one's highly likely...
30/08/2025, 22:38 - +44 7958 612614: the problem with Farage is that he sees Trump’s policies that are only meant to be a bridge to some more substantial ones - as end goals
30/08/2025, 22:38 - Parag-meetup: One on the boats ? 
Brexit brigade ?
30/08/2025, 22:38 - Will-hazzer777: On international flights

30/08/2025, 22:39 - Parag-meetup: Is he gonna join us back with Europe ?
30/08/2025, 22:39 - Parag-meetup: Partake in the Dublin agreement ?
30/08/2025, 22:39 - +44 7958 612614: lol, back with Europe - we might be better off getting into a coalition with Rwanda
30/08/2025, 22:39 - Will-hazzer777: No... But the imf may insist that we do between now and 2029...
30/08/2025, 22:40 - Parag-meetup: You think we are better off with Rwanda than Europe ?
30/08/2025, 22:41 - Will-hazzer777: If we do... Then I'll try and get out of the UK and head to Poland, Hungary, East Germany or somewhere like that.
30/08/2025, 22:41 - Will-hazzer777: Romania is always a possibility
30/08/2025, 22:41 - +44 7958 612614: What’s wrong with Rwanda or Congo?
30/08/2025, 22:42 - Parag-meetup: East Germany ? 
Are we in 1977v
30/08/2025, 22:42 - Parag-meetup: Sudan v
30/08/2025, 22:42 - Parag-meetup: Gaza ?
30/08/2025, 22:42 - +44 7958 612614: There’s a lot of neo Nazis in East Germany
30/08/2025, 22:42 - Parag-meetup: Eastern Germany
30/08/2025, 22:43 - Parag-meetup: It’s 2025
30/08/2025, 22:43 - +44 7958 612614: no, it’s not
30/08/2025, 22:43 - Parag-meetup: Go to sleep

The police initially did not detain the man when he pointed them to her body, but later DNA tests revealed his fingerprints on her shoulder, leading investigators to conclude she had been violently grabbed.

German authorities said the suspect had a blood alcohol level of 1.35‰ and a history of paranoid schizophrenia. He was placed in a psychiatric facility and is under investigation for unintentional homicide."

01/09/2025, 21:40 - Parag-meetup: Don’t you think that’s how all tin hat conspitacist think of all the rest 
Or cult followers think of the rest ?
01/09/2025, 21:43 - Will-hazzer777: It's definitely not the rest... Just observing how the average is declining precipitously.
01/09/2025, 21:58 - Will-hazzer777: It's not xenophobia anyway...
It's a foreign country - Germany
The dead girl is foreign - Ukrainian 
The attacker is foreign -
Iraqi

Xenophobia implies I have a fear of the foreign... But all of the components of the story are to do with all things foreign.

02/09/2025, 08:47 - +44 7958 612614: it is - you’re deliberately pushing news about foreigners committing crimes in order to influence people.
02/09/2025, 08:48 - +44 7958 612614: the guy’s mentally ill, he killed a girl and you find it funny!
02/09/2025, 10:27 - Will-hazzer777: They're all mentally ill apparently...

02/09/2025, 11:02 - +44 7958 612614: “they” ??  Who’s they?  foreigners?
02/09/2025, 11:02 - +44 7958 612614: maybe because you’re not a true westerner?  Enlightenment hasn’t reached you yet.
02/09/2025, 11:04 - Will-hazzer777: Whatever you might consider 'enlightenment' will soon be extinguished.
02/09/2025, 11:05 - +44 7958 612614: by whom?  Little Englanders?
02/09/2025, 11:08 - Will-hazzer777: Whatever remnant of civilization remains you'll not be allowed to come close to it. You shall be flung into the outer darkness where you deserve to be.

02/09/2025, 11:11 - Will-hazzer777: Whatever you have shall be taken from you and your descendants and given to others, both in your own lifetime and after you have departed this world.
02/09/2025, 11:12 - +44 7958 612614: OMG - not from my descendants.  Can they keep their iPhones?
02/09/2025, 11:13 - +44 7958 612614: who’s you and who’s others?  You sound possessed this morning

02/09/2025, 11:18 - +44 7958 612614: you’ve finally tried psychodelics 🥳
02/09/2025, 11:21 - Will-hazzer777: "The gnomes have learned a new way to say hooray"
02/09/2025, 11:22 - +44 7958 612614: were they on psychodelics?  I mean, probably - Pink Floyd 😉
02/09/2025, 11:36 - onur: Psychedelics
02/09/2025, 11:36 - onur: :D
02/09/2025, 11:43 - Will-hazzer777: "You will build a house, but you will not live in it. You will plant a vineyard, but you will not even begin to enjoy its fruit. Your ox will be slaughtered before your eyes, but you will eat none of it."

"A people that you do not know will eat what your land and labor produce, and you will have nothing but cruel oppression all your days. The sights you see will drive you mad."

"All these curses will come on you. They will pursue you and overtake you until you are destroyed, because you did not obey the Lord your God and observe the commands and decrees he gave you."
 https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy%2028&version=NIV#
02/09/2025, 11:44 - Will-hazzer777: Highly likely, though you don't necessarily need to be on psychedelics to see the gnomes at the bottom of your bed.
02/09/2025, 11:56 - +44 7958 612614: all of these concerns are on the lowest rung of the Maslow’s pyramid of needs.  spend your life worrying about dystopian future, your choice

02/09/2025, 12:02 - +44 7599 430972: Wtf did Sauron enter the chat
02/09/2025, 12:50 - +44 7446 051842: Well atleast Martin will have descendants. WHEYYYY!
02/09/2025, 12:58 - +44 7516 029853: There’s a huge difference between being cheeky and being a knobhead
02/09/2025, 13:02 - +44 7958 612614: You’re all my disciples!
02/09/2025, 13:05 - +44 7958 612614: anyway, I don’t buy the concept of “descendants” - it’s a meaningless, made-up concept.  It’s not like the genes that you’re passing are unique - it’s just the combination.  You could be putting together  people based on your combination of genes - synthetic descendants?
02/09/2025, 13:07 - +44 7446 051842: Shoot me.
02/09/2025, 13:08 - +44 7958 612614: is that your consent?
02/09/2025, 13:08 - +44 7516 029853: Obviously. He is done by now
02/09/2025, 13:08 - +44 7958 612614: I’ll get the ip address and record the consent <This message was edited>
02/09/2025, 13:08 - +44 7446 051842: I think descendants are the people you put all your resources into looking after.
02/09/2025, 13:09 - +44 7516 029853: The only reason I think I might have kids in the future is that I want this world to have more people with some of my genes. Literally the only reason.

Having a demanding alien growing inside one's belly for 9 months doesn't sound appealing to me at all 😊
02/09/2025, 13:09 - +44 7958 612614: ??  “all your resources” - you mean “bare legal minimum”?
02/09/2025, 13:09 - +44 7446 051842: Right.
02/09/2025, 13:10 - +44 7958 612614: what’s so special about your genes?  Just curious
02/09/2025, 13:10 - +44 7446 051842: I think looking after a little human (above the age of 3 because actually infants are really annoying) sounds fun from time to time.
02/09/2025, 13:11 - +44 7958 612614: you think that something sounds like… You’re 3 steps from the truth
02/09/2025, 13:11 - Parag-meetup: That’s an interesting topic 
Why should one have children 

I think it’s becasue you want more of your Philisophy in the world
02/09/2025, 13:12 - +44 7446 051842: Also that.
02/09/2025, 13:12 - +44 7516 029853: One of them is that I am ambidextrous. I honestly think it would be nice to have more people like me in general
02/09/2025, 13:13 - +44 7446 051842: However I think you get something out of an altruistic outpouring of yourself into a little human.
02/09/2025, 13:13 - +44 7958 612614: i’m ambidextrous + can speak backwards.  Big deal.  Give us something more substantial 😜
02/09/2025, 13:14 - +44 7516 029853: Can you write with both hands simultaneously? I can, though it's difficult
02/09/2025, 13:14 - Will-hazzer777: I already knew he had kids he thinks are horrible, that he tries to palm off responsibility on God for, so I thats taken for granted... And he'll have grandchildren so long as his kids aren't too selfish...
02/09/2025, 13:14 - +44 7958 612614: the same - i can, but not with great skill.  Also, I’ve never practiced, seemed like a useless ability.
02/09/2025, 13:15 - +44 7446 051842: Adopted kids are also descendants by this definition and younger friends aswell as pupils.
02/09/2025, 13:16 - +44 7516 029853: My ambidexterity was serving me well as an orchestra conductor. Now it's mostly useless
02/09/2025, 13:16 - +44 7958 612614: well, we clearly speak too much.  Anyway, I don’t regret/hate kids, but for me every human is potentially equally important to me - as long as I like them or find them interesting…. I totally discard familiar ties as something “special”
02/09/2025, 13:17 - +44 7446 051842: I don’t disregard the fact that you put so much effort into those little ones, as unspecial though.
02/09/2025, 13:17 - +44 7958 612614: and also, because I believe in meta-consciousness - I think that all egos are just individuations of the same ego
02/09/2025, 13:18 - +44 7958 612614: well, you may be enjoying it - but if you didn’t know other people’s kids are not yours - you’d be investing yourself equally
02/09/2025, 13:18 - +44 7516 029853: Oh, apart from preserving some genes.
From a more selfish perspective, I think kids are absolutely incomprehensibly creative and curious. It's like having a whole new planet around you.
02/09/2025, 13:19 - onur: I had a trip like this once
02/09/2025, 13:19 - +44 7446 051842: Why.
02/09/2025, 13:19 - +44 7958 612614: so - there’s no difference between your and other people’s kids - you might like someone else’s kids better than yours - but it’s also possible that you’ll actually like your kids more than any other kids...
02/09/2025, 13:19 - +44 7958 612614: ❤️
02/09/2025, 13:19 - +44 7958 612614: why what??
02/09/2025, 13:20 - +44 7446 051842: Why do you believe in meta consciousness? <This message was edited>
02/09/2025, 13:20 - Will-hazzer777: It's only because you think they're horrible....
02/09/2025, 13:20 - +44 7958 612614: why one believes??  That’s a meta-question
02/09/2025, 13:20 - +44 7958 612614: no, my kids are not horrible
02/09/2025, 13:20 - onur: Because he is a believer

02/09/2025, 13:22 - +44 7958 612614: maybe I was exaggerating - I usually do that because I hate people who go on about how great their kids are, especially in teh presence of other people who don’t have any.  When kids become the reson-d’etre of your life - you might as well die
02/09/2025, 13:23 - +44 7958 612614: clearly a joke
02/09/2025, 13:23 - Will-hazzer777: Yeah and so is mine

"A religious leader has been charged with illegally allowing two children to marry each other.

Ashraf Osmani, 52, of Abington Avenue, Northampton, has been charged under forced marriage legislation, according to Northamptonshire Police."

05/09/2025, 10:19 - Will-hazzer777: They could just do what Lidl does which is that you need to scan your receipt to get out of the self checkout area. But better - like a turnstile type situation potentially. Needs thinking through...
05/09/2025, 10:20 - Will-hazzer777: The shoplifting costs a lot actually
05/09/2025, 10:27 - +353 89 605 0161: Back to everything behind the till and you give the shop assistant your shopping list 👍
05/09/2025, 10:34 - +353 89 605 0161: That stops people who don't pay by mistake their card hits its contactless limit and theyre in auto pilot.
But I guess what they're trying to tackle is people deliberately not scanning everything, or putting it all through the scales as potatoes.

Facial recognition as theft prevention _at the checkout_ is a red herring.
05/09/2025, 11:09 - +44 7516 029853: Btw, have you ever used those automatic shops like the Amazon Fresh close to Tate Modern? I have nothing against being watched, but I remember I had some troubles because I carry digital pay only, and the system was glitching.

Anyway, it was not automatic to begin with. I am ok with Big Brother but not as much with that https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/apr/10/amazon-ai-cashier-less-shops-humans-technology

05/09/2025, 20:34 - +44 7599 430972: It does pass through one generation in eastern european tradition

05/09/2025, 20:34 - +44 7599 430972: Nah she could only heal back pain and sense demons
05/09/2025, 20:36 - +44 7516 029853: Did she have to attend an exorcism session? It's very popular in Moldova. Every week in Chisinau, and it's free to attend (I did)
05/09/2025, 20:36 - +44 7599 430972: Nah she just converted to christianity
05/09/2025, 20:37 - +44 7599 430972: In Belarussian tradition you can’t stop being a witch until you pass your talent (and your contract with the devil) to someone else
05/09/2025, 20:39 - +44 7516 029853: I am not sure if it's that structured in Moldova. But I think Moldovans believe that if there was a witch in the family - it will stay that way for many generations to come, passing it to kids/grandkids. Mostly girls.
05/09/2025, 20:40 - +44 7599 430972: Yeah similar, you can’t really escape the contract with the devil
05/09/2025, 20:40 - +44 7599 430972: Ukrainian tradition is slightly different
05/09/2025, 20:40 - +44 7516 029853: I was assigned to take the lead lol, but instead I just make silly manifestations just because it's fun.
05/09/2025, 20:40 - +44 7599 430972: There your ancestral witches and witchers don’t really die and become the thralls for next generations
05/09/2025, 20:41 - +44 7599 430972: And I think in Russian tradition you don’t have to be binded by blood to pass the contract, but you need to pass all your imps (little devil servants) as well
05/09/2025, 20:42 - +44 7516 029853: I grew up in the capital, so unfortunately I didn't experience much of that, but in Moldovan villages all the pagan stuff is still very strong.
05/09/2025, 20:42 - +44 7516 029853: Yeah, you can be possessed by proximity
05/09/2025, 20:42 - +44 7516 029853: Quite unfair and too depressing
05/09/2025, 20:44 - +44 7599 430972: My mother (and grandmother) were telling me the witchcraft they claim they saw, like actual ghosts, demons and premonitions
05/09/2025, 20:44 - +44 7516 029853: Yeah, mine too (except for the russian grandma, she was a communist)
05/09/2025, 20:45 - +44 7516 029853: Like a real one, so obviously an atheist
05/09/2025, 20:45 - +44 7599 430972: I think I had paranormal events happening to me like twice
05/09/2025, 20:46 - +44 7516 029853: Do you have wizards in Belarus? Are they almost non-existent like in Moldova, or is it quite developed?
05/09/2025, 20:46 - +44 7599 430972: Yes but male witchcraft is different
05/09/2025, 20:50 - +44 7599 430972: There are certain types of witches:
1. Whisperers are the ones who “whisper” spells on some secret language that mostly cure people
2. ⁠Fixers that can fix one particular thing - bad hearing for example by performing some ritual someone told them
3. ⁠Full-on witches - that can transform into animals, give jinxes and evil eyes and speak and command demons
4. ⁠Black book holders - people who have a special black book only they can read (my mother claimed she saw this book) and by reading incantation from there you perform a spell
5. ⁠Enchanters - people who do crafts (usually weave) that can have a supernatural ability
6. ⁠Herbalists - just people good at herbs
7. ⁠Holy fools - people without abilities but seeing demons and having some form of foresight
05/09/2025, 20:51 - +44 7599 430972: So men are usually number 4, 7 and rarely 1
05/09/2025, 20:51 - +44 7599 430972: Women are the rest
05/09/2025, 20:57 - +44 7516 029853: Interesting!
Is it specific to Belarusian culture?
05/09/2025, 20:58 - +44 7516 029853: or Pan-Slavic?
05/09/2025, 21:19 - +44 7516 029853: I had to refresh my memory, but I can confidently say that Moldovan witches have different functions and a different structure, though there is some overlap.
05/09/2025, 21:51 - Parag-meetup: https://www.instagram.com/reel/DODTGSiDNa3/?igsh=bjExZmJnZmc2OGx1
05/09/2025, 22:05 - +44 7599 430972: I would say there are common pan-Slavic elements but this list is compiled from my knowledge of belarussian witchcraft specifically
05/09/2025, 22:07 - +44 7446 051842: Yeah get them to the care home.
05/09/2025, 22:07 - +44 7446 051842: You too.
05/09/2025, 22:07 - +44 7446 051842: (Joking!)
05/09/2025, 22:08 - +44 7446 051842: Oh my days.
05/09/2025, 22:10 - +44 7599 430972: I'd say Belarusian mythos is less syncretic that Russian. Analyzing Russian folk stories you'd notice it much more demon-angel focused and there is a lot of Christian god (surprisingly pagan gods remained too). Belarussian folklore is less religious, although spells made to look like common prayers.
05/09/2025, 22:12 - +44 7446 051842: Do you believe this stuff?
05/09/2025, 23:30 - +44 7516 029853: Moldovan witches rarely transfer their knowledge through a book. It is usually either through mom (de la mamă la fiică) but much more often it's pure fate and chance. 
It's also not predetermined when and how it's going to happen. 
Do Belarusian witches have rules for that?
05/09/2025, 23:32 - +44 7599 430972: Most commonly the transfer happens to a grandchild or a relative that is “one away” from you. Witches normally don’t transfer powers when they’re ok as it benefits them, but when it’s time to die they suffer greatly and cannot pass until the power is transferred. I think the reasoning is that demons are torturing them before collecting their soul for hell
05/09/2025, 23:34 - +44 7599 430972: There is a story told by my mother that one witch couldn’t die for a week and was screaming every night so the villagefolk disassembled her roof (so the soul could pass easier). That’s why when witches die children and youngling are hiden away from them
05/09/2025, 23:34 - +44 7516 029853: Yes, the demon is strongly present, of course, in Moldovan/Romanian folklore, but it's much more nuanced. As well as witches. Most Moldovan/Romanian witches have their speciality, but it's usually both good and bad. So you have a healer, but she can curse as well. 
I think that's quite separate from many Slavic cultures. <This message was edited>
05/09/2025, 23:35 - +44 7599 430972: I think something similal happened during papal conclave
05/09/2025, 23:35 - +44 7599 430972: The roof was disassembled as it took so long and they “hoped it will help the holy spirit reach them”
05/09/2025, 23:35 - +44 7516 029853: So in Belarusian culture being a witch is more like a curse? It's very different from what I was observing in Moldova.
05/09/2025, 23:38 - +44 7599 430972: I would say it’s definitely more “satan-tied” in Russia, specifically Komi-Permyaks mythology. Belarussian witches are not connected to Satan directly (although they must visit it’s ball once a year) - they are mostly a big nuisance to the village
05/09/2025, 23:38 - +44 7599 430972: I think this yearly visit was an inspiration for Bulgakov’s Master and Margarita ending
05/09/2025, 23:39 - +44 7516 029853: Remember reading it and trying to understand why it was so demon-centred. Makes more sense now
05/09/2025, 23:40 - +44 7516 029853: Though he was Ukrainian-born, it must be a mix of cultures
05/09/2025, 23:40 - +44 7599 430972: I think where Christianity was more strongly enforced the paganism blended in and adapted it into the system
05/09/2025, 23:41 - +44 7599 430972: Gogol also drove a lot from Ukrainian paganistic mythos
05/09/2025, 23:41 - +44 7599 430972: In Russian witchcraft the christian icons (even ones in the church) can be possessed by a demon for example
05/09/2025, 23:42 - +44 7599 430972: I never heard of this thing in Belarussian myths. Although usually the priest is a bad guy there anyways
05/09/2025, 23:42 - +44 7516 029853: I think even Gogol took that snapshot and used it several times, right?
05/09/2025, 23:43 - +44 7516 029853: Blending with the Ukrainian  folklore
05/09/2025, 23:43 - +44 7516 029853: specific to Полісся
05/09/2025, 23:43 - +44 7599 430972: Yeah now when I think of it in Viy the protagonist was in church when paranormal stuff was happening
05/09/2025, 23:43 - +44 7599 430972: So the church is not sacred or off limits
05/09/2025, 23:44 - +44 7599 430972: Yeah my mother is from that region, south-west of Belarus
05/09/2025, 23:44 - +44 7599 430972: The most “paranormal” one
05/09/2025, 23:45 - +44 7516 029853: Oh, makes sense now.
I wanted to ask if your mom is from a small town/village or a bug city
05/09/2025, 23:45 - +44 7599 430972: Bessarabia is relatively paranormal region too, isn’t it?
05/09/2025, 23:45 - +44 7599 430972: small village
05/09/2025, 23:46 - +44 7599 430972: I think the swamps and mountains play a huge role
05/09/2025, 23:46 - +44 7516 029853: Yeah, she definitely preserved much more than my mom (who was from the capital of Moldova)
05/09/2025, 23:47 - +44 7516 029853: Absolutely.
And geo-politics had a huge impact. Moldova was on the edge of every major change, so any regime would not spend too much time on eradication of the folklore.
05/09/2025, 23:50 - +44 7516 029853: When we were part of Romania, it wasn't even needed.
The Soviets were quite aggressive and successful at russification, obviously, but they were focused on the capital only, hence my partial ignorance.
05/09/2025, 23:51 - +44 7599 430972: Yeah, I also think a lot of this folks stories are recorded but not really studied
05/09/2025, 23:52 - +44 7599 430972: There are works about eastern european fairy tales (Propp) but not really about horror - I’ve read much more analysis on american horror and wikkism
05/09/2025, 23:53 - +44 7516 029853: And those studied and saved during the Soviet Union were very much crafted in a specific way, as you surely know
05/09/2025, 23:54 - +44 7599 430972: I also enjoy the fact that eastern european witchcraft has the most “hard” magical system I found in a natural mythology
05/09/2025, 23:55 - +44 7516 029853: You mean in Europe or in the world? If in Europe alone, that sounds plausible
05/09/2025, 23:55 - +44 7599 430972: Japanese yokais for example are quite diverse and sometimes don’t look like they belong together
05/09/2025, 23:55 - +44 7599 430972: Where eastern european monsters kinda fit together
05/09/2025, 23:55 - +44 7599 430972: Maybe it’s my cultural bias
05/09/2025, 23:56 - +44 7516 029853: I think it's also quite hard to compare then as we discussed above - it's mostly preserved in stories and memories, not in writing and in translations
05/09/2025, 23:56 - +44 7599 430972: Fair
05/09/2025, 23:57 - +44 7516 029853: Feel free to send a list of articles/books on that topic <This message was edited>
05/09/2025, 23:58 - +44 7516 029853: Also, I was thinking about witches and realised that it might have had a much bigger impact on me growing up, than I think. Culturally, I mean <This message was edited>
06/09/2025, 00:00 - +44 7599 430972: Did you know that movie “The Craft” inspired Katy Perry’s Dark Horse music video?

06/09/2025, 00:03 - +44 7516 029853: Did you read one of the most famous poems in Moldova and Romania? 
It's called "Luceafarul" (Lucifer).

06/09/2025, 00:07 - +44 7599 430972: There was an interesting argument I remember that Lucifer represent our fear of perfection as I believe he’s canonically the perfect creation
06/09/2025, 00:07 - +44 7516 029853: Lots of romantic tension between the celestial and the cosmic, life gets in the way, while folklore and mysticism makes it incredibly interesting and deep.
06/09/2025, 00:09 - +44 7516 029853: In that article? The last one?

06/09/2025, 00:10 - +44 7599 430972: Nope I believe it was in a conversation I once had
06/09/2025, 00:11 - +44 7599 430972: Like isn’t Lucifer canonically so beautiful you wouldn’t be able resist him
06/09/2025, 00:11 - +44 7599 430972: And at the same time the worst sinner
06/09/2025, 00:12 - +44 7516 029853: That was the premise of Eminescu's Lucaefarul
06/09/2025, 00:12 - +44 7516 029853: But in Romania/Moldova, as we discussed above, the demon isn't that demonic
06/09/2025, 00:12 - +44 7516 029853: And sins are a bit different, though the concept still exists
06/09/2025, 00:13 - +44 7599 430972: In Russian witchcraft you can transfer sins btw
06/09/2025, 00:13 - +44 7516 029853: wdym?
06/09/2025, 00:13 - +44 7599 430972: Or send a person to do something and tell you’d take the sin in their stead
06/09/2025, 00:14 - +44 7599 430972: Like “sin” is not just a quality of action but sort of… currency?
06/09/2025, 00:15 - +44 7516 029853: ah, this thing 

like in Medieval time buying indulgence
06/09/2025, 00:15 - +44 7599 430972: Yeah but you would negotiate it with a god or god’s representative right
06/09/2025, 00:16 - +44 7599 430972: Like you’d go to a church and buy a paper
06/09/2025, 00:16 - +44 7599 430972: Not trade your sins with a witch
06/09/2025, 00:18 - +44 7516 029853: Yeah, very business-focused approach.
I am not sure it's a thing in Moldovan folklore. 
Is it present in Belarusian or Ukrainian?
06/09/2025, 00:19 - +44 7599 430972: More in Komi (Russia)
06/09/2025, 00:20 - +44 7599 430972: In Belarus you can take someone’s sin on your name
06/09/2025, 00:20 - +44 7516 029853: Like a curse or just transfer it?
06/09/2025, 00:22 - +44 7599 430972: Transfer it
06/09/2025, 00:23 - +44 7599 430972: «Взять грех на душу»
06/09/2025, 00:23 - +44 7599 430972: Those books were recommended to me

D.K. Zelenin. Essays on Russian mythology: those who died an unnatural death and mermaids. S.V. Maksimov. Undead, unknown and holy power.
06/09/2025, 00:24 - +44 7516 029853: Speaking of folklore preservation. Although my grandma was from Bashkiria (a republic in Russia with a predominance of mulsims), due to living in a big city, like her parents, they preserved close to 0% folklore knowledge
06/09/2025, 00:24 - +44 7516 029853: Yeah, a concept I could never fully understand <This message was edited>
06/09/2025, 00:25 - +44 7599 430972: This is a good lecture although in russian
https://youtu.be/uYTFHg_hycE?si=B07jK6vNYu_i7Rag
06/09/2025, 00:25 - +44 7516 029853: My brain is limited to curses, not sin transfers
06/09/2025, 00:27 - +44 7599 430972: There is certain city “proto-mythos” too. Like people have superstition about elevators, stairs and peepholes
06/09/2025, 00:27 - +44 7599 430972: But I think it hasn’t developed in a folk mythology (yet)
06/09/2025, 00:29 - +44 7516 029853: Definitely. As well as children's songs, but it was never as rich as folklore, especially in places the governments deemed to be "unimportant".
06/09/2025, 00:29 - +44 7516 029853: We have memes instead
06/09/2025, 00:30 - +44 7599 430972: I think cities added a new paranormal cultural meme by forcing people into houses and flat that were inhabited by someone else (not even your relative and sometimes even by someone who died and left it unoccupied)
06/09/2025, 00:31 - +44 7599 430972: A lot of paranormal shit left by “previous occupiers”
06/09/2025, 00:32 - +44 7516 029853: Good observation.
As well cursed phone numbers etc.
06/09/2025, 00:33 - +44 7516 029853: And many urban myths
06/09/2025, 00:33 - +44 7516 029853: Though it all goes back to elements of folklore and paranormal ties to respective cultures
06/09/2025, 00:34 - +44 7516 029853: I wonder if there's a book comparing urban myths in different parts of the world. There should be
06/09/2025, 00:36 - +44 7599 430972: Well if someone willing to sponsor my PhD I can write one!
06/09/2025, 00:36 - +44 7599 430972: Although it would be hard to localise areas as everything spreads quickly through internet now
06/09/2025, 00:39 - +44 7516 029853: It's time for me to want Katy Perry’s Dark Horse music video 🙃

It was very interesting talking to you! 

Night ✨
06/09/2025, 00:40 - +44 7599 430972: Goodnight!
06/09/2025, 09:55 - +44 7516 029853: Just to let you know that I sprinkled some goodness through your day.
Let me know how it goes later on

06/09/2025, 13:15 - +44 7516 029853: Also, I have an update regarding human remains display ethics from my former flatmate:
"Well, this is a question that depends on a particular culture, context, and remains. In general, there is no consensus that it is okay to show them in museums, there are many different ethical discussions about this. Some specific remains (for example, of people from the colonies who were stolen by the British, or people who did not want their remains displayed when they were alive) are the subject of intense debate. Some remains are removed from museums for burial or return to their homeland.

The general consensus is that for educational purposes and in a controlled context, it is okay to display human remains because it improves human understanding and provides the community with needed knowledge, but in practice it is not that simple, as very few of these remains are from donors who have agreed to this.

There is also a consensus about historical remains, because they have no family or sometimes even no community to influence their fate. But even here, things are not so simple. There are no problems with a dead Viking in Denmark, but there are problems with Egyptian mummies because they were stolen from Egypt. Or with remains from African countries, even historical ones. The whole problem is in connection with the community and the history, culture, and traumas of this community.

The ideal scenario is when either the donor or the community of the historical donor voluntarily donates the remains for educational purposes. But this scenario rarely happens.

Well, now it's more frequent. In the future, maybe it will be the norm."

@⁨Will-hazzer777⁩
06/09/2025, 13:18 - Will-hazzer777: If there's a problem with displaying mummies from Egypt because they were supposedly 'stolen'... Then say that they were 'stolen', don't beat around the bush and make up some cobblers about the ethics of displaying them in museums.
06/09/2025, 13:20 - Will-hazzer777: The problem is is that even in Egyptian museums in Egypt mummies are being displayed for the public to look at.
06/09/2025, 13:21 - Will-hazzer777: You could display photographs, however if you're going to display photographs why not the real deal. What's the big difference?

06/09/2025, 13:22 - +44 7516 029853: pure magic, yes 🙃
06/09/2025, 13:23 - Will-hazzer777: The problem with Egyptian artifacts that we taken during colonial times is that many were taken with expressed permission and were bought and paid for.
06/09/2025, 13:26 - Will-hazzer777: A century and a half later or more successor states don't like the price that they were handed over for and demand them back as they didn't know their worth. However if they were thinking straight they'd also understand that they wouldn't attract any further footfall even if they got them back. People just wouldn't especially go to see them in their country of origin. <This message was edited>
06/09/2025, 13:27 - onur: u know they are turkic right?
06/09/2025, 13:27 - onur: they are like more turks than turks in Türkiye :D
06/09/2025, 13:28 - onur: combination of Turkic words baş, meaning 'head', 'chief', 'main', 'principal' and qurt meaning 'wolf' (one of the animals regarded as sacred to Turkic peoples);[26] the suffix -stan is Persian, commonly used for many Eurasian territorial names. Bashkirs speak the Bashkir language, which belongs to the Kipchak branch of the Turkic language group
06/09/2025, 13:30 - onur: it probably has at this point
06/09/2025, 13:31 - onur: like Marilyn manson removed his ribs to suck himself
06/09/2025, 13:31 - onur: :DDD
06/09/2025, 13:43 - +44 7516 029853: Yes, i know, though it would be interesting to see how exactly the cultural canvas of Bashkirs has changed due to geopolitics. 

Are you familiar with the Gagauz people? They are the Turkish ethnic minority in Moldova with a form of governmental autonomy
06/09/2025, 13:43 - onur: yeah I am they are another horde
06/09/2025, 13:43 - onur: we learn them at school <This message was edited>

06/09/2025, 13:46 - onur: Who cares
06/09/2025, 13:46 - onur: You are dead
06/09/2025, 13:46 - Will-hazzer777: But what would you have wanted?
06/09/2025, 13:47 - onur: It doesnt matter
06/09/2025, 13:47 - onur: I dont genuinely care
06/09/2025, 13:47 - onur: They can even fuck my corpse or smth
06/09/2025, 13:47 - onur: Who cares
06/09/2025, 13:47 - Will-hazzer777: How about other things after you're dead?
06/09/2025, 13:48 - onur: Like what?
06/09/2025, 13:48 - Will-hazzer777: I don't know like your last will and testimony?
06/09/2025, 13:48 - onur: I dont have anything to leave except for the stuff in my room
06/09/2025, 13:49 - Will-hazzer777: That'd be necrophilia @⁨Ali⁩
06/09/2025, 13:49 - +44 7516 029853: They are heavily influenced by the russian propaganda. And we already have "Transnistria", so the Gagauz Republic is another issue we must address, given our relatively young democracy.
06/09/2025, 13:49 - Will-hazzer777: Who would you leave it to?
06/09/2025, 13:50 - onur: So u supports kurds but dont like your own seperatists
06/09/2025, 13:50 - onur: How interesting and unique

06/09/2025, 13:50 - onur: 😂😂🤪
06/09/2025, 13:50 - onur: My sister
06/09/2025, 13:50 - +44 7516 029853: Oh, it is because we are not imperialists, but the Turks are. Perfect logic.
06/09/2025, 13:50 - Will-hazzer777: Novorossiya
06/09/2025, 13:51 - onur: I play crusader kings so you had your chance to be imperial too but lost
06/09/2025, 13:51 - onur: :D
06/09/2025, 13:52 - Will-hazzer777: Tiny tiny pieces of land.
06/09/2025, 13:52 - onur: 😁
06/09/2025, 13:52 - onur: You should play ck3 too
06/09/2025, 13:52 - onur: Its your game bro
06/09/2025, 13:53 - onur: My fav thing to do is getting a no name tribe from eastern europe make them muslims and fight against france and holy rome
06/09/2025, 13:53 - onur: 🤣🤣
06/09/2025, 13:53 - Will-hazzer777: Maybe, but I'd be wasting my time I think... Maybe when I'm an old man... If I get that far.
06/09/2025, 13:53 - +44 7516 029853: I am a genuine underdog supporter. I can't change even if I try. 
So Kurds seem to be cool and deserving of my compassion, especially due to their strong female characters. The moment an "underdog" is too religious and misogynistic, I switch my support.
06/09/2025, 13:54 - Will-hazzer777: The meek shall inherit the earth
06/09/2025, 13:55 - onur: They are more underminers than underdogs lol
06/09/2025, 13:56 - +44 7516 029853: Moldova's whole population is 2.3 million, those tiny places are not that tiny when it comes to elections. \
06/09/2025, 13:56 - onur: A whole 2.3m!

06/09/2025, 13:59 - +44 7516 029853: That is exactly what many countries did.

06/09/2025, 14:00 - +44 7516 029853: You are talking about the size as if... oh yeah - boys! 🫠
06/09/2025, 14:01 - onur: Due to its strategic location on a route between Asia and Europe, Moldova was repeatedly invaded by, among others, the Goths, Huns, Avars, Magyars, Pechenegs, Cumans, and the Mongols.
06/09/2025, 14:01 - onur: Im a size queen
06/09/2025, 14:01 - Will-hazzer777: But it's about population density.

How to bring down an empire

06/09/2025, 18:50 - +44 7516 029853: In 2023, when I was planning my trip to Ukraine since the full-scale invasion started, I decided to write a will.
Forgot to mention that I do care about my body not being engaged in sexual activities without consent even when I am gone, but cremation is seriously important to me.
06/09/2025, 18:51 - +44 7958 612614: why? why do you care what happens after you're gone from this world? <This message was edited>
06/09/2025, 18:52 - +44 7958 612614: you're a hopeless romantic 😁
06/09/2025, 18:53 - +44 7516 029853: I would donate my dead body to science or would be a donor, at least it's useful.
06/09/2025, 18:53 - +44 7516 029853: Unfortunately 🥲
06/09/2025, 18:53 - +44 7958 612614: why? what's there left after you've left?
06/09/2025, 18:53 - +44 7958 612614: and then the ones after you will eventually have left too
06/09/2025, 18:54 - +44 7516 029853: Because I am making this decision while still alive, thus very self-centred
06/09/2025, 18:54 - +44 7516 029853: Obviously I won't care when gone
06/09/2025, 18:54 - +44 7958 612614: oh, you're creating this illusion that you matter beyond your life
06/09/2025, 18:55 - +44 7516 029853: Nah
06/09/2025, 18:56 - +44 7516 029853: Death is meaningful until reached
06/09/2025, 18:56 - onur: Guys nothing matters everyones gonna die just do drugs, have sex and see art
06/09/2025, 18:56 - +44 7958 612614: it's never meaningful
06/09/2025, 18:57 - +44 7958 612614: just finished the magic mountain by thomas mann
06/09/2025, 18:57 - +44 7516 029853: Tell it to Jesus
06/09/2025, 18:57 - +44 7516 029853: Better don't and apologise for your rude comment ☠️
06/09/2025, 18:58 - +44 7958 612614: rude?
06/09/2025, 18:58 - +44 7516 029853: Watch the Seventh Seal by Bergman
06/09/2025, 18:59 - +44 7958 612614: saw that 10 years ago
06/09/2025, 19:00 - +44 7516 029853: Death can be meaningless indeed, but it's not universally meaningless. The limited time due to inevitable death is one of the biggest catalysts for life.
06/09/2025, 19:00 - +44 7516 029853: But you still somehow question the meaning of death...
06/09/2025, 19:03 - +44 7958 612614: there's no meaning of life - there's a broader context that  goes on beyond life and death
06/09/2025, 19:04 - +44 7516 029853: There's no *set* meaning of life
06/09/2025, 19:05 - +44 7958 612614: no, i meant - there's no much difference between life and death - it's just specifics
06/09/2025, 19:06 - +44 7958 612614: like observing a planet and not realising there are seasons <This message was edited>
06/09/2025, 19:07 - +44 7958 612614: yep, you missed there are seasons, but it's a specificity that either matters or not
06/09/2025, 19:08 - +44 7958 612614: but for humans - everything is about life and death
06/09/2025, 19:09 - +44 7958 612614: because before birth there was objective, during life there's subjective and after you died there's objective again
06/09/2025, 19:09 - +44 7958 612614: but what's that subjective/objective?
06/09/2025, 19:10 - +44 7958 612614: objective is the thing - subjective is the individuation
06/09/2025, 19:13 - +44 7516 029853: I see it very differently. More thorough a perspective close to Jung's theory of two opposite forces, tied together and shaping the movement or stillness of each other, depending on a particular experience. 
Like the erotic (in the meaning of being alive) and static, unmovable (where death is the ultimate stop)
06/09/2025, 19:13 - +44 7958 612614: still a human perspective
06/09/2025, 19:13 - +44 7516 029853: I am a human, yes
06/09/2025, 19:14 - +44 7958 612614: btw i also like that perspective but it's not meta
06/09/2025, 19:14 - +44 7516 029853: Before birth there was history and knowledge. I can't say it's objective
06/09/2025, 19:15 - +44 7958 612614: and there are truths at every level
06/09/2025, 19:15 - +44 7958 612614: but there are embedded cognitive contexts like Russian dolls
06/09/2025, 19:15 - +44 7958 612614: and they are integral - the wider concept contains sub contexts
06/09/2025, 19:17 - +44 7958 612614: well the only subject is you - soo it wasn't subjective
06/09/2025, 19:17 - +44 7516 029853: I see it much less like Russian dolls and more like an infinite number of knowledge, semantic clusters, being grouped and taken by individuals and groups
06/09/2025, 19:18 - +44 7958 612614: what you're describing is on the same cognitive/contextusl level
06/09/2025, 19:22 - +44 7958 612614: knowledge, semantics are only interpretative concepts
06/09/2025, 19:22 - +44 7958 612614: to understand and communicate higher levels
06/09/2025, 19:22 - +44 7958 612614: try and understand
06/09/2025, 19:22 - +44 7958 612614: because we never can
06/09/2025, 19:23 - +44 7958 612614: unless we go up the level
06/09/2025, 19:23 - +44 7516 029853: We clearly can, at least it's enough to create meaning for some
06/09/2025, 19:23 - +44 7958 612614: you can create s meaning out of anything
06/09/2025, 19:23 - +44 7516 029853: And we also operate on multiple levels not just as individuals
06/09/2025, 19:24 - +44 7958 612614: we only operate on human level and levels below (because it's cumulative and integral)
06/09/2025, 19:25 - +44 7958 612614: so we understand savages and primitive urges
06/09/2025, 19:25 - +44 7958 612614: but but anything above us
06/09/2025, 19:25 - +44 7516 029853: Doesn't contradict the fact that death has meaning just because we use meaning for meaningless things as well
06/09/2025, 19:25 - +44 7516 029853: What's above us? The space? The whole Universe? We are working on it, there's science
06/09/2025, 19:25 - +44 7958 612614: maybe subjective meaning / but it's nothing special
06/09/2025, 19:26 - +44 7958 612614: exactly - you can't think of it
06/09/2025, 19:26 - +44 7516 029853: I can. Many would say god etc
06/09/2025, 19:26 - +44 7958 612614: lol - science is just reverse engineering
06/09/2025, 19:28 - +44 7516 029853: You're being rude again.
First you said Jesus died for nothing, now attacking science for just reverse engineering ☠️
(joking, obviously)
06/09/2025, 19:28 - onur: Jesus died for our sins
06/09/2025, 19:28 - +44 7958 612614: that proves hiw restricted we are - imagining another human form slightly bigger and more powerful
06/09/2025, 19:28 - +44 7516 029853: There's more than Christianity just in case
06/09/2025, 19:29 - +44 7516 029853: Dozens of forms having no Jesus or anything similar
06/09/2025, 19:29 - +44 7958 612614: i'm not joking - its just what life forms do - break, observe, memorise, communicate, temper, try again...
06/09/2025, 19:35 - +44 7516 029853: I must go 💨
Good to chat!
And hope the sprinkles worked well 🙃
06/09/2025, 19:36 - +44 7958 612614: capsized 4 times during sailing race. thanks. a bunch
06/09/2025, 19:36 - +44 7958 612614: at least i didn't drown
06/09/2025, 19:36 - +44 7516 029853: You see!
06/09/2025, 19:36 - +44 7516 029853: Works
06/09/2025, 19:36 - +44 7958 612614: i've never drowned in my entire life
06/09/2025, 19:38 - +44 7516 029853: Keep the record until you're too bored with this meaningless life ☺️
06/09/2025, 19:38 - +44 7958 612614: oh, it's fun, just meaningless
06/09/2025, 19:41 - +44 7516 029853: P.S. You're not that good at manifesting, and I purposely kept it the way you asked. You asked for something good - you received it 🙃

06/09/2025, 21:43 - +44 7516 029853: Yes, it isn't fun and memes, and I was hacked by @⁨Will-hazzer777⁩  but it illustrates my "underdog" moral stance: "A prohibition on contact between unrelated women and men meant many women’s wounds went untended and some were left trapped under rubble after a deadly earthquake, witnesses said. “They gathered us in one corner and forgot about us,” she said. No one offered the women help, asked what they needed or even approached them.
Tahzeebullah Muhazeb, a male volunteer who traveled to Mazar Dara, also in Kunar Province, said that members of the all-male medical team there were hesitant to pull women out from under the rubble of collapsed buildings. Trapped and injured women were left under stones, waiting for women from other villages to reach the site and dig them out." https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/04/world/asia/afghanistan-earthquake-rescue-efforts-women.html

06/09/2025, 21:56 - +44 7958 612614: are you sure you're vocal about all underdogs?
06/09/2025, 22:06 - Will-hazzer777: What you can't get through to yourself is that these people will never change. They'll come here and on the whole be themselves also. You nor anyone will change them. This is how they are. You shouldn't expect anything else.
06/09/2025, 22:13 - Will-hazzer777: There are no underdogs... Life and time doesn't care about underdogs, all it cares about is who is a winner and who is a loser.

Those who wail too much about underdogs are usually underdogs themselves but find it too difficult to vocalise their underdog position because it's embarrassing.

I have more respect for people who wail about their own position than other people's, that at least shows some tenacity.

It must be remembered that 99% of the time the underdogs people wail about wouldn't hesitate to sacrifice you in their attempt to become an 'overdog'.
06/09/2025, 22:16 - Will-hazzer777: " The Anabaptist being upon deck bore a hand; when a brutish sailor struck him roughly and laid him sprawling; but with the violence of the blow he himself tumbled head foremost overboard, and stuck upon a piece of the broken mast. Honest James ran to his assistance, hauled him up, and from the effort he made was precipitated into the sea in sight of the sailor, who left him to perish, without deigning to look at him. "

06/09/2025, 22:28 - +44 7958 612614: there are no underdogs because life and time don't care about them.  do life and time care about sofas - if not and the sofa i'm sitting on doesn't exist - then i'm levitating
06/09/2025, 22:28 - Will-hazzer777: It doesn't really care about upholstery in general... But new seating arrangements will always be needed.
06/09/2025, 22:29 - +44 7958 612614: needed by time or life?
06/09/2025, 22:30 - Will-hazzer777: Both... You need time to lounge on a sofa and life in order to lounge.

06/09/2025, 22:39 - Will-hazzer777: Queers for Palestine are such a  example of an oxymoronic organisation.

Similarly liberals who gets into bed with Islamists such as in the Green party or Jeremy Corbyn's new party. <This message was edited>
06/09/2025, 22:39 - Will-hazzer777: Yeah... Beer is too dear...
06/09/2025, 22:42 - +44 7958 612614: too much demand - migrants effect
06/09/2025, 22:42 - +44 7958 612614: actually, i've noticed a lot of stuff has gone up in price - i've only been away for 2.5 months
06/09/2025, 22:43 - Will-hazzer777: I don't drink beer very often, it's just a persona I like to give off...
06/09/2025, 22:43 - +44 7958 612614: went into a local charity shop - t-shirts 14 squids
06/09/2025, 22:43 - Will-hazzer777: Where were you?
06/09/2025, 22:43 - +44 7958 612614: bohemian airs?

06/09/2025, 22:44 - Will-hazzer777: "No good deed goes unpunished"
06/09/2025, 22:50 - +44 7516 029853: I have never said I am vocal about every underdog. I am openly selective towards them - actively supporting only those I find relatable and worth of my quite limited compassion
06/09/2025, 22:51 - +44 7516 029853: I also deeply believe that a person carrying about "all people" etc cannot be trusted
06/09/2025, 22:52 - Will-hazzer777: When I see young people overly concerned with people almost wholely unrelated to them, I see it as a evolutionary misfiring. The instinct of concern, which was an adaptation for one's own group's survival is misfiring when we see people from other groups in need... A bit like when people say domestic dogs and cats are cute... It's just a misfiring in parts of the brain which evolved to be adapted to find babies and small children cute.
06/09/2025, 22:57 - Will-hazzer777: "This nurturing instinct could even be driving our wider perception of cuteness – research has shown that we typically feel affection for animals with juvenile features. Dogs, for instance, have been bred to have similar features to babies, with big eyes, bulging craniums and recessed chins. "

06/09/2025, 22:59 - +44 7446 051842: Disagree on the basis that by fighting in empathy of a group you gain a relationship with that group that won’t be forgotten.
06/09/2025, 23:00 - +44 7446 051842: Empathy is in no limited supply.
06/09/2025, 23:01 - +44 7446 051842: Define Islamist.
06/09/2025, 23:02 - Will-hazzer777: It will be totally forgotten and disregarded... Bit like how the Bolsheviks were massacred after the revolution in Russia and how the brown shirts and Röhm were murdered after Hitler got to power.

They're just being used but are just too dumb to see it.
06/09/2025, 23:03 - +44 7446 051842: I am against punching someone, but if someone punched someone, and in unrelated circumstances their family was killed. I’d feel bad for them.
06/09/2025, 23:04 - +44 7446 051842: Israel did major pinkwashing.
06/09/2025, 23:04 - Will-hazzer777: Anyone who might agree with culturally aligned practices with Islam that any liberal might consider extreme.
06/09/2025, 23:04 - +44 7446 051842: Easy to be a cynic.
06/09/2025, 23:05 - Will-hazzer777: It's not just easy it's the most rational assessment of the situation.
06/09/2025, 23:05 - +44 7446 051842: Could a Muslim not agree with culturally aligned practices with Islam?
06/09/2025, 23:05 - +44 7446 051842: Answer this scenario.
06/09/2025, 23:05 - Will-hazzer777: Small numbers of individuals might, but power isn't derived from individuals. <This message was edited>
06/09/2025, 23:06 - +44 7446 051842: Could you give an example of a Muslim who didn’t culturally agree with Islam?
06/09/2025, 23:06 - +44 7446 051842: Also there are power in individuals. An individual with a rifle is powerful.
06/09/2025, 23:09 - +44 7446 051842: Even if you could prove every single person who’s been killed so far is deeply homophobic (You can’t a lot of them are children). I still don’t think a race of people should be exterminated for being homophobic. Israel is pinkwashing, queers for Palestine is calling them out. <This message was edited>
06/09/2025, 23:10 - +44 7958 612614: you believe that people should be selectively compassionate and if they are not selective - you don’t trust them?
06/09/2025, 23:11 - Will-hazzer777: After the islamic revolution in Iran there was a violent conflict between the Islamists and some of their former leftist allies, particularly the Mojahedin-e Khalq (MEK), following the overthrow of the Shah. 

The Islamists, led by Ayatollah Khomeini, consolidated power and began to suppress and execute members of the MEK, leading to a deadly cycle of attacks and reprisals in the early 1980s.
06/09/2025, 23:11 - Will-hazzer777: The leftists just get used...
06/09/2025, 23:11 - +44 7446 051842: Stop trusting me.
06/09/2025, 23:11 - +44 7446 051842: Address this, I’ll read it in the morning.
06/09/2025, 23:12 - Will-hazzer777: I actually can't... That's the worrying thing...
06/09/2025, 23:12 - +44 7446 051842: So you think all Muslims are Islamists by your definition.
 (What a bozo.) <This message was edited>
06/09/2025, 23:13 - Will-hazzer777: I'm basing my definition on what I think a guardian reader might consider extremist.
06/09/2025, 23:14 - +44 7958 612614: who were Bolsheviks massacred by after the Russian revolutin?
06/09/2025, 23:15 - Will-hazzer777: Stalin's regime during 'The Great Purge'.
06/09/2025, 23:15 - +44 7958 612614: you mean Bolsheviks?
06/09/2025, 23:15 - +44 7958 612614: “Stalin’s regime” lol - who’s your spin doctor?
06/09/2025, 23:16 - Will-hazzer777: Yes the Bolsheviks were purged in mass executions after Stalin got to power... But he would have only got to power because of the Bolsheviks in the first place... So leftists getting used as useful idiots again...
06/09/2025, 23:16 - +44 7958 612614: Who do you think Stalin was?  Was he not a bolshevik?
06/09/2025, 23:17 - +44 7516 029853: With some nuances
06/09/2025, 23:18 - +44 7958 612614: but can they be selectively compassionate for people you’re not compassionate about - would that make them fully trustworthy?
06/09/2025, 23:20 - +44 7516 029853: Lack of discernment makes people untrustworthy — and vice versa <This message was edited>
06/09/2025, 23:20 - Will-hazzer777: Yes, but it's like saying everyone in the Green party is in the green party....but we all know that there are factions and that they are really uneasy bed fellows.
06/09/2025, 23:22 - +44 7958 612614: so whoever has an alternative position to yours suffers from the lack of discernment.
06/09/2025, 23:23 - +44 7958 612614: Not sure that I follow - it’s like saying that everyone on the bus is not on the bus?  Was the distinction capital Green party to lower case green party?  Bus and bus? <This message was edited>
06/09/2025, 23:25 - Will-hazzer777: The leftists think that everyone in the green party are leftists... But we all know that's not true... The other half are Islamists and are happy to let the leftists do the driving until an opportune time when they can stab them in the back and drive the bus from then on in. Leftists just getting used, dumb fucks all of them.
06/09/2025, 23:25 - +44 7516 029853: Edited the message as sent it prematurely by mistake (using an iPad to type is not the smartest idea)
06/09/2025, 23:26 - +44 7958 612614: just like we know that not everyone on the bus is actually on the bus - so why are they all buying tickets?  Refund is in order!
06/09/2025, 23:26 - Will-hazzer777: No refunds... That was stated in the small print.
06/09/2025, 23:26 - +44 7958 612614: “Islamists” “lefties” “dumb fucks” - you’re just drowning in labels but not coming up with much sense
06/09/2025, 23:27 - +44 7958 612614: like not everyone who is green is green - but everyone who is leftist is leftist and everyone who is islamist is islamist - it’s really not your day 🙁
06/09/2025, 23:28 - Will-hazzer777: The Islamists aren't dumb, they just don't know how to drive.... The leftists are the ones being taken for a ride, they just don't know it yet, because they think they're behind the steering wheel doing the hard work.
06/09/2025, 23:29 - +44 7958 612614: so both islamists and leftists are on the bus as passengers (because they cannot drive ) - but who’s driver of the bus?
06/09/2025, 23:29 - Will-hazzer777: We're talking about a subset if you can get your mind around that... A microcosm if you will.
06/09/2025, 23:29 - Will-hazzer777: The leftists are driving the bus.
06/09/2025, 23:30 - +44 7958 612614: you said that leftists are the ones being taken for a ride (on the bus presumably) - so who’s behind the wheel?
06/09/2025, 23:31 - Will-hazzer777: It's like a man being given a shovel and being tasked to dig a hole... He just doesn't know yet that it's his own grave that he's digging.
06/09/2025, 23:31 - +44 7958 612614: how did we get from the bus to the hole and from driving the bus to digging the grave?
06/09/2025, 23:31 - Will-hazzer777: Activity...
06/09/2025, 23:32 - +44 7958 612614: leftist, islamist, green, queer ?  whose activity?
06/09/2025, 23:32 - +44 7958 612614: liberals?
06/09/2025, 23:32 - Will-hazzer777: And subterfuge
06/09/2025, 23:32 - +44 7958 612614: dumb fucks?
06/09/2025, 23:32 - +44 7958 612614: migranta?
06/09/2025, 23:32 - +44 7958 612614: asylum seekers?
06/09/2025, 23:32 - Will-hazzer777: Exactly, dumb fucks... Liberals/leftists... Same difference.
06/09/2025, 23:33 - +44 7958 612614: come on, you must have had a drink or three
06/09/2025, 23:33 - Will-hazzer777: The migrants aren't dumb... It's the ones who seek to help them that are.
06/09/2025, 23:33 - +44 7958 612614: either that or you’re having a stroke 😳
06/09/2025, 23:33 - Will-hazzer777: I don't smell popcorn...
06/09/2025, 23:33 - +44 7958 612614: ok, so whoever needs help is not dumb but whoever offers help is dumb
06/09/2025, 23:33 - Will-hazzer777: Or burning toast
06/09/2025, 23:34 - +44 7958 612614: phew
06/09/2025, 23:34 - +44 7958 612614: good to hear!
06/09/2025, 23:34 - +44 7958 612614: is that some sort of IQ test?
06/09/2025, 23:34 - Will-hazzer777: Yeah the one who offers help without discernment is a dumb fuck.
06/09/2025, 23:35 - Will-hazzer777: Unfortunately not... It's just a symptom of a stroke I believe.
06/09/2025, 23:35 - +44 7958 612614: and the quality of discernment is determined by you?
06/09/2025, 23:35 - +44 7958 612614: no I meant - who needs help is not dumb
06/09/2025, 23:35 - Will-hazzer777: Nope, it's determined by the consequences.
06/09/2025, 23:35 - +44 7958 612614: and the consequence is known before the event?
06/09/2025, 23:36 - Will-hazzer777: Well if you didn't have some element of predictive power everything that happens would be a surprise to you... I'm starting to think it must be...
06/09/2025, 23:37 - +44 7958 612614: so when you offer help without the discernment (knowing the consequence ) - you’re dumb.  You should offer help after the consequence of your potential help becomes known, right?
06/09/2025, 23:38 - Will-hazzer777: Yeah the person who offers help without recourse to consideration of the consequences for themselves or/and those around them is a dumb fuck.
06/09/2025, 23:38 - +44 7958 612614: nothing surprising ever happens to me and I don’t think i have any special powers <This message was edited>
06/09/2025, 23:38 - Will-hazzer777: I think you don't have any ordinary ones either.
06/09/2025, 23:38 - +44 7958 612614: what’s the recourse to consideration of the consequences?
06/09/2025, 23:38 - +44 7958 612614: that’s true as well
06/09/2025, 23:43 - Will-hazzer777: Every so often there are stories of good Samaritans who get the shitty end of the stick by being a goodie two shoes... Usually the situation is breaking up a fight or trying to help deranged unhinged people who end up attacking them. These people have no discernment at all and wander about the place as though everything is in their control and that they nor their families are going to get hurt in the process of their do-goodery.
06/09/2025, 23:44 - Will-hazzer777: "Hassan Jhangur, 25, ploughed into a crowd of people, including Chris Marriott, in Burngreave, Sheffield, after a family feud erupted into violence.

Father-of-two Mr Marriott, 46, who had stopped to help Jhangur's own sister as she lay injured in College Close, died from his injuries.

Police described him as a "good Samaritan" who had paid for his kindness with his life."

06/09/2025, 23:45 - +44 7958 612614: every so often there are stories of mothers dying during labour.  There are stories of investors losing their money, drivers dying in car accidents, surfers getting eaten by sharks - all of these people lack discernment, right?
06/09/2025, 23:46 - +44 7958 612614: midnight islamophobia or just plain vanilla xenophobia?

What I'm highlighting are people actively putting themselves in harms way but not realising that they are.

06/09/2025, 23:50 - Will-hazzer777: I honestly think that leftists don't understand and won't until their both their neighbourhoods are trashed and their bank balances have been emptied.
06/09/2025, 23:50 - +44 7958 612614: Women during childbirth

Global context:

Around 287,000 women died from maternal causes in 2020 (WHO estimate).

That’s about 1 death every 2 minutes worldwide.
06/09/2025, 23:51 - +44 7958 612614: ood Samaritans (helping in emergencies)

Risks depend heavily on the situation:

Intervening in crimes/violence: risk of assault, stabbing, shooting.

Rescuing in accidents (fires, drowning, crashes): risk of injury or death.

Incidence:

Much rarer than childbirth — only a small fraction of the population ever face serious harm while helping strangers.

Hard to get global figures, but studies of bystander intervention in violent crime suggest serious injury/death for helpers is very low overall compared to maternal mortality rates.

06/09/2025, 23:56 - +44 7958 612614: Honestly, you know I’m not a sucker for nonsense, so not sure why are you trying to fool me by publishing these article links.  How many children killed their parents or parents children - probably more than good samaritans
06/09/2025, 23:56 - +44 7958 612614: probably more pets killed their owners
06/09/2025, 23:57 - +44 7958 612614: probably more people got trampled by cows
06/09/2025, 23:58 - Will-hazzer777: It's not a comparable scenario because childbirth is about you and your "community, lineage, family" etc. it's a worthwhile risk to take.

Intervening in the affairs of random strangers to help them but who may in fact mean you harm or might come to that conclusion isn't in you or your "community, lineage, family's" interest. <This message was edited>

The one's who go whole-hog libtard are the type that typically remove themselves and their family members prematurely from the planet.
07/09/2025, 00:06 - +44 7958 612614: ok, so you’ve been let down by the libtards.  They are obfuscating the access to the information.  Libtards are dumb fucks, leftists and liberals (in no particular order)?  Just to clarify. <This message was edited>

07/09/2025, 11:07 - +44 7446 051842: There are no ‘misfires’ in evolutionary biology, because there is no ‘purpose’ to evolution. It’s just a natural process. There is no will behind the hand. ‘Mis’ implies something is going wrong. There is no wrong or right in evolution.

07/09/2025, 11:11 - +44 7446 051842: I don’t think the underdogs will sacrifice the overdogs to become overdogs. I think the way the world is currently set up, having principles goes generally unrewarded so a lot of people who have principles never make it to the top. Keeping a good balance of pragmatism and principle is the only real way to help people as of current.
07/09/2025, 11:14 - +44 7446 051842: I think having principles is fine. We must admit to ourselves we don’t really know what the consequences of our actions will be and the more removed our actions are from their consequences the more useful living by principle is. If we had time or the ability to research the effects of every action we take we would. 
Also there are some lines you shouldn’t cross because you don’t want to be a bad leader and set a bad moral example, for example torture. Creating that bad prescedent you may have to account for in your utility equation, but you may find it difficult because the more human actors you factor in the less certain your utility equation becomes. <This message was edited>
07/09/2025, 11:18 - Will-hazzer777: There is no final end goal or purpose.... nonetheless there are still environmental reasons for particular evolved phenotypes for the purpose of survival in those original contexts.

The original contexts were when we lived in bands of 50-150 people. Phenotypic adaption hasn't caught up with urban cosmopolitan living. 

It will do though, so long as modern city living continues for large extended periods of human existence (which I don't think it will)
07/09/2025, 11:20 - +44 7958 612614: lol, you picked the “original context” that suits you.  The original context was no groups of people because there were no people.  What do you think that the original context of social and solitary animals was?  It was a common context that evolved further into polarities totally divorced from the original context.  Hollow arguments, as usual
07/09/2025, 11:20 - Will-hazzer777: It's a dog eat dog world out there and you better believe it.

It's not that they will sacrifice an overdog to climb the pecking ladder, they will climb over the bodies of other underdogs who were further up the ladder than they were.
07/09/2025, 11:20 - +44 7446 051842: The way you use and define ‘reason’ here changes how correct you are. Evolution doesn’t have intent, but it does have causes. Causes are reasons why things happen, but there is no ‘should’ therefore no ‘mis’ fire.
07/09/2025, 11:22 - +44 7446 051842: It’s a dog eat dog world some places, it’s a mutual vulnerability space in others. Some people best the prisoners dilemma.

However take my dad's situation where he has been working for London underground.

A older lady had been mugged by a man who has taken her bag and he approached the assailant, perhaps even tried to snatch the bag back off of him, and was rewarded with a thump around the head which ultimately led to him having to take early retirement.

My dad acted on principle first, without thinking what are the consequences going to be for himself or his family, nor whether such an alternation was worth the stolen items.

07/09/2025, 11:34 - Will-hazzer777: What I'm saying is that the environment has changed and our evolution, especially if our brains, has not kept up. Most of humanity were living in small rural communities until very very recently.
07/09/2025, 11:34 - +44 7958 612614: what’s most people?  51% vs 49% ?  So as long as you’re statistically not guaranteed reciprocity - you shouldn’t do it?  Don’t you think that there are other variables that would affect the odds?  Like the quality of engagement, etc..?
07/09/2025, 11:34 - +44 7446 051842: I agree, but I don’t think that’s a problem. I think it means we have overcome our flesh.

07/09/2025, 11:40 - +44 7958 612614: yep, but @⁨Will-hazzer777⁩  will say that we have no historical precedents for it and therefore it's doomed to fail
07/09/2025, 11:40 - +44 7446 051842: We’ve been drinking alchohol for god knows how long.
07/09/2025, 11:40 - +44 7446 051842: First time baby.
07/09/2025, 11:40 - +44 7958 612614: why not just breaking out?  Why half-way solution?   Risk management?  Too much of a good thing?
07/09/2025, 11:41 - Will-hazzer777: There wasn't that much honey and it was predominantly for rich people. Apiary wasn't common. The honey available was predominantly wild honey which was seasonal.
07/09/2025, 11:41 - +44 7446 051842: True breaking out is assimilating ourselves into a collective consciousness via computing.
07/09/2025, 11:42 - +44 7366 377608: Yea fuck tht
07/09/2025, 11:42 - +44 7446 051842: That is a huge amount of biology tomfuckery none the less.
07/09/2025, 11:42 - +44 7958 612614: you don’t need computers for that
07/09/2025, 11:42 - +44 7446 051842: Nah actually don’t, it would be cool.
07/09/2025, 11:42 - +44 7446 051842: Stop advertising LSD bro.
07/09/2025, 11:43 - Will-hazzer777: I'm not saying it's impossible.... I have a theory that the brain is just an antenna not a storage device.
07/09/2025, 11:43 - +44 7958 612614: and also - you reduce your consciuosness back into collective or global consiousness
07/09/2025, 11:43 - +44 7958 612614: ok, so now you’re starting to make a bit of sense
07/09/2025, 11:43 - +44 7446 051842: China brain thought experiment sort of overcomes that problem.
07/09/2025, 11:44 - +44 7958 612614: <Media omitted>
07/09/2025, 11:45 - Will-hazzer777: Not at the strength we have it now though. It was generally weak beers... Plus it wasn't universal.

That's why east Asians can't process it and why aboriginal peoples lost their shit when they first came in contact with it. <This message was edited>
07/09/2025, 11:46 - +44 7958 612614: not true - people were drinking themselves blind - we have moderation now.  That was limited to rituals, ceremonies because most of the time people needed to look for food
07/09/2025, 11:46 - +44 7446 051842: Vodka existed pre industrially, this is another great example of fucking with our biology at large.
07/09/2025, 11:46 - +44 7958 612614: all brandies existed pre industrially
07/09/2025, 11:46 - +44 7446 051842: Alcohol and honey on toast probably did us no good.
07/09/2025, 11:46 - +44 7446 051842: However glasses, that did us well. <This message was edited>
07/09/2025, 11:47 - Will-hazzer777: Which brain thought experiment?
07/09/2025, 11:47 - onur: 100 micrograms isnt a little
07/09/2025, 11:47 - +44 7958 612614: straws are definitely post-industrial
07/09/2025, 11:47 - +44 7446 051842: Look it up real quick, sort of long to explain.
07/09/2025, 11:47 - +44 7958 612614: a wimp!
07/09/2025, 11:48 - onur: Its stupid
07/09/2025, 11:48 - +44 7446 051842: Stop bravadoing psychedelic drugs.
07/09/2025, 11:48 - Will-hazzer777: The mass produced highly distilled versions of it are new... Most people did not have access to such strengths of alcohol.
07/09/2025, 11:48 - Will-hazzer777: It wasn't common
07/09/2025, 11:48 - +44 7446 051842: Definitely but what we had before was enough to be considered a major bio fuck.
07/09/2025, 11:48 - +44 7446 051842: They are just getting more major.
07/09/2025, 11:48 - +44 7446 051842: As time goes on.
07/09/2025, 11:48 - onur: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_room
07/09/2025, 11:48 - Will-hazzer777: Yes but most people didn't even have access to it.
07/09/2025, 11:49 - +44 7446 051842: These two are a good example.
07/09/2025, 11:49 - onur: Why not
07/09/2025, 11:49 - +44 7446 051842: This is the wrong one.
07/09/2025, 11:49 - +44 7446 051842: I’m talking China Brain.
07/09/2025, 11:49 - +44 7446 051842: Different thought experiment. <This message was edited>
07/09/2025, 11:50 - +44 7446 051842: I don’t want a one-up-manship starting.
07/09/2025, 11:51 - onur: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_brain
07/09/2025, 11:51 - +44 7958 612614: who cares if it was common or not?  People drank more to reach the same alcohol concentration.  Again, what’s your point?
07/09/2025, 11:52 - onur: Well 100 micrograms are not that of a low dose and @⁨Will-hazzer777⁩ didnt do any psychedelics so cant really one up ;D
07/09/2025, 11:52 - +44 7958 612614: what?
07/09/2025, 11:52 - onur: And doesnt need to one up because 100 is already high
07/09/2025, 11:52 - onur: If like 30-40 Id say it would be helpful against anxiety
07/09/2025, 11:52 - onur: Maybe
07/09/2025, 11:52 - onur: :D
07/09/2025, 11:52 - +44 7958 612614: @⁨Will-hazzer777⁩ would benefit - he needs therapy
07/09/2025, 11:52 - onur: 100 is too much
07/09/2025, 11:53 - +44 7958 612614: I went to a decentralised science meetup and spoke to people who ran the clinical trials - they were not successful - I think the dosage was too low
07/09/2025, 11:53 - onur: Like after 150 it is considered a high dose or smth :D
07/09/2025, 11:53 - onur: Bro
07/09/2025, 11:53 - +44 7958 612614: bur irt’s all individual - but for the sake of trials - they need to get it right
07/09/2025, 11:53 - onur: If you are only to reduce anxiety
07/09/2025, 11:53 - onur: Idk how it works
07/09/2025, 11:54 - onur: I get anxious during a trip
07/09/2025, 11:54 - +44 7958 612614: the problem is - it can amplify it or reduce
07/09/2025, 11:54 - onur: Id be anxious about a 100 micro for sure
07/09/2025, 11:54 - Will-hazzer777: Well they didn't because they weren't that rich.
07/09/2025, 11:54 - onur: I dont think for a first timer most of the time it wont reduce
07/09/2025, 11:54 - onur: :D
07/09/2025, 11:55 - +44 7958 612614: monkeys get drunk on fermented fruit - they are pretty poor.  elephants get high on some stuff - dolphins smoke puffer fish
07/09/2025, 11:55 - onur: If you are hypervigilant event 50 micro can make you anxious
07/09/2025, 11:55 - +44 7958 612614: well, marijuana makes some people anxious - yet it relaxes others
07/09/2025, 11:56 - onur: I guess
07/09/2025, 11:56 - Parag-meetup: Nobel peace prize worthy
07/09/2025, 11:56 - +44 7958 612614: actually, very scary
07/09/2025, 11:56 - onur: Its a mentality change you wouldnt understand
07/09/2025, 11:56 - onur: 😂
07/09/2025, 11:57 - +44 7958 612614: extra judicial killings
07/09/2025, 11:57 - +44 7958 612614: and with the low cost of sending a drone - the oversight / justification barrier will be brought right down
07/09/2025, 11:58 - +44 7958 612614: and international law is dead anyway - so big countries will only adhere to their own internal laws
07/09/2025, 11:59 - Parag-meetup: Meh , that’s not principe , that’s short term thinking 

The war to go about it is to consider what would lead to the best outcome in this particular situation according to my philosophy of life . Consider the probability and acting on it . 

Acting in the heat of moment , showing bravado or personal sacrifice is actually a loss for long term outcomes !
07/09/2025, 12:00 - Parag-meetup: Not taking away anything from your dads intention
07/09/2025, 12:02 - Parag-meetup: What’s that ?
07/09/2025, 12:02 - Will-hazzer777: As far as I understand my father, he is a man who instinctively acts out of principle. If he sees something isn't right he'll try to do something about it but forget him own condition which some might call short term thinking....but I think acting out of principle is short term thinking.

In my mind, they are synonyms.
07/09/2025, 12:02 - Parag-meetup: Why does it matter what people think on their death bed 
If they get to think
07/09/2025, 12:03 - Will-hazzer777: I don't think that's how it works...
07/09/2025, 12:03 - Will-hazzer777: We all have different value structures
07/09/2025, 12:04 - Parag-meetup: And he did well with that situation 
But it doesn’t put the statement that , acting on principles is a bad thing 

It’s short term / intinctivr thinking vs long term / planned behavior which is the issue here
07/09/2025, 12:04 - Will-hazzer777: I think that's what a lot of people can't get their heads around.
07/09/2025, 12:05 - +44 7958 612614: ok, you can’t help having principles - but you can choose whether to act or not,.  Culturally and socially - not acting out of principles has been considered cowardice, so that’s what people are trying to project - courage, because it’s socially appreciated.  Obviously, there are risks - both operational opportunity risks and social condemnation that might come out of the disalignment of personal principles with the ones commonly held
07/09/2025, 12:06 - +44 7958 612614: so doomed if you do and doomed if you don’t - but one needs to do something
07/09/2025, 12:06 - Will-hazzer777: Acting on principle is a bad thing. 

One must act based on consequences not principles.

The situation in Ukraine is a case example of how acting on principle puts you and everyone else in your society on the shitty end of the stick.

People need to wake up and live in the real world.
07/09/2025, 12:07 - +44 7958 612614: and you preaching and practicing “not being in the world and with others” is definitely a loser strategy.  None of your heroes do it - Trump, Farage - they go out on a limb.  Only losers play the safe game - if you don’t engage - you live a wasted or unlived life.  I think that’s something you need to work on <This message was edited>
07/09/2025, 12:08 - Will-hazzer777: It might be thought of as brave etc... but on balance I'd prefer to walk away with my life than to be thought of as brave.
07/09/2025, 12:08 - +44 7958 612614: and what you’re doing is justifying your shortcoming by inventing a twisted weak philosophy that justifies your disposition
07/09/2025, 12:08 - Will-hazzer777: When I'm dead and gone.
07/09/2025, 12:09 - +44 7958 612614: well, you don’t live your life to the full - you’re not realising yourself.  You’re putting the lid on
07/09/2025, 12:09 - +44 7958 612614: and that is a sign of trauma
07/09/2025, 12:09 - +44 7958 612614: and self-coping
07/09/2025, 12:09 - +44 7958 612614: I mean - we all here and everywhere do it to an extent
07/09/2025, 12:09 - +44 7958 612614: but you exceed in publicly trying to justify it
07/09/2025, 12:10 - +44 7958 612614: as though you can change the world so it becomes traumatised in your own brand of trauma
07/09/2025, 12:10 - +44 7958 612614: in the countryside where I spend some time - that’s overwhelming “peasant wisdom"
07/09/2025, 12:10 - Will-hazzer777: I'm more than happy for people to continue in their evolutionary mismatches. 

They're doing a service to the race by having them selves removed from the face of the planet.
07/09/2025, 12:10 - Will-hazzer777: It's evolution in action
07/09/2025, 12:11 - Will-hazzer777: I'm not justifying my own way of being, I'm pouring cold water over others'.
07/09/2025, 12:11 - +44 7958 612614: this year i was told by several people that the time has come to forget other people, just to focus on your own interests - the death of idealism is what will eventually kill you as well, because when it comes to individual interests - we know what kind of people do well in those conditions.  Not you or the neighbours I spoke to .  It’s warriors
07/09/2025, 12:12 - +44 7958 612614: yep, to put the lid on them so they become subdued in teh same way that you are
07/09/2025, 12:12 - +44 7958 612614: but it’s not attractive to anyone
07/09/2025, 12:17 - Will-hazzer777: Like I said, I'm all for community spirit... I.e. your community, your family, your lineage, your friends, the people you know and love and who love you.

However when it comes to sacrifices made on act of idealism alone, with no recourse to consequences, for people who wouldn't reciprocate, for people who would even harm you in return for the help you have shown for them, to put your life and limb in harms way for total strangers without thinking about the consequences for yourself or your own family... Then I just see that as selection pressure against Libtardery. <This message was edited>
07/09/2025, 12:17 - Will-hazzer777: That's fine... They'll be remembered with as much attractiveness as yesterday's chip paper.
07/09/2025, 12:21 - Will-hazzer777: The people who fall for it are the same gullible numpties who fell for WWI propaganda.
07/09/2025, 12:22 - Will-hazzer777: <Media omitted>
07/09/2025, 12:22 - Will-hazzer777: Daddy, What Did You Do in the Great War?
07/09/2025, 12:22 - +44 7958 612614: “the people you know” - what do you think where they come from?  They come from people you don’t know, then you get to know them and then they become your friends.  You’re like mRNA - just an unviable piece of genetic material that contains some information but not enough for the context
07/09/2025, 12:24 - Will-hazzer777: The problem with you is that you don't keep friends easily and because we live in urban environments with high churn rates... You turn to idealism to sooth the part of yourself that might have wanted a stable community around you.
07/09/2025, 12:24 - +44 7958 612614: you fall for far right propaganda all the time and your arguments are lamentably weak and not thought through.  Last couple of days you’ve really plunged the depths of bad argumentation
07/09/2025, 12:25 - Will-hazzer777: It's all a matter of opinion that I hear
07/09/2025, 12:25 - +44 7958 612614: well, you’re right - i don’t keep same people around - but I have a stable environment in terms of I reliable create the circle of transient friends
07/09/2025, 12:26 - +44 7958 612614: so a high churn and that’s in line with “engaging with the world” and taking opportunities
07/09/2025, 12:26 - +44 7958 612614: because that’s all we’ve got and that’s all we are supposed to be doing
07/09/2025, 12:31 - Will-hazzer777: No thought was given for the kids who lost their father's during the great war... It was all about looking to be 'brave' or a 'hero' and thinking that they'll be coming back to questions from their progeny that might shame them.

If I was asked... I would say... 

"Dearest daughter I stayed out of the fighting so that you had a daddy to ask such an impertinent question to. Your friends weren't quite so lucky to have a daddy that thought to stay alive for them and that's why they're in poverty now."
07/09/2025, 12:31 - Will-hazzer777: It's unnatural and you know it.
07/09/2025, 12:32 - +44 7958 612614: “unnatural”?  like being homosexual or leftist or liberal is?
07/09/2025, 12:32 - +44 7446 051842: Mixed opinions on this.
07/09/2025, 12:32 - +44 7958 612614: maybe that’s your strongest trait - average
07/09/2025, 12:33 - Will-hazzer777: Yeah well...
07/09/2025, 12:33 - +44 7958 612614: because despite teh fact that you’re outspoken about your ideology - that ideology is widely shared among a large number of people
07/09/2025, 12:33 - +44 7446 051842: Who cares.
07/09/2025, 12:33 - +44 7446 051842: More detail later.
07/09/2025, 12:33 - Will-hazzer777: As in.... it's new to our primitive brains.
07/09/2025, 12:34 - +44 7446 051842: So are glasses.
07/09/2025, 12:34 - +44 7446 051842: Natural ≠ Good.
07/09/2025, 12:34 - +44 7958 612614: so, is it good?  Is it better to be conservative - pulling towards previous key-frames of evolution or to head into the future ones?
07/09/2025, 12:35 - Will-hazzer777: My stance isn't ideological... Universalism however is an ideology.
07/09/2025, 12:35 - +44 7446 051842: ‘My stance isn’t ideological.’
07/09/2025, 12:35 - +44 7958 612614: you’re deeply ideological - single perspective un-empathetic ideology
07/09/2025, 12:36 - +44 7958 612614: I completely understand your position - it’s quite common, but not necessarily readily voiced
07/09/2025, 12:36 - +44 7446 051842: <Media omitted>
07/09/2025, 12:36 - +44 7958 612614: you’re uttering what’s on minds of many people
07/09/2025, 12:37 - Will-hazzer777: I'm just pointing out flaws in thinking due to evolutionary mismatches...

People will continue to do what they do, whatever I might say... I'm quite certain whatever I might say will not change anyone's actions. That's not my intention.
07/09/2025, 12:37 - onur: If they arent islamist why are they called green party?
07/09/2025, 12:37 - +44 7446 051842: No ‘mis’ if there is no ‘bad’
07/09/2025, 12:37 - +44 7446 051842: Yeah mum’s.
07/09/2025, 12:38 - +44 7958 612614: why do you need to always add “evolutionary”?  Evolution is the agreed term for describing the process of change in live organisms - by that definition - any change is by default evolutionary.  it really doesnt’ make your arguments any stronger.
07/09/2025, 12:38 - onur: Not any change is evolutionary
07/09/2025, 12:38 - +44 7958 612614: I’m listening
07/09/2025, 12:38 - +44 7446 051842: ‘My stance isn’t ideological.’ 
‘It’s a dog eat dog world out there.’
07/09/2025, 12:38 - onur: The change in distribution of genes and attributes in the population
07/09/2025, 12:39 - onur: Is evolutionary
07/09/2025, 12:39 - onur: Isnt it?
07/09/2025, 12:39 - Will-hazzer777: I don't think it's that common. I think that most people have some environmental adaptability to living in high churn, evolutionary mismatched environments. However I'm just saying that it catches out those who don't.
07/09/2025, 12:39 - +44 7446 051842: Not everywhere.
07/09/2025, 12:39 - +44 7446 051842: Uncommon ≠ Correct.
07/09/2025, 12:39 - +44 7446 051842: Genealogy fallacy.
07/09/2025, 12:39 - onur: Well in 200 out of 220 countries
07/09/2025, 12:39 - onur: :D
07/09/2025, 12:40 - +44 7958 612614: “evironmental adaptibility” Evolutionary mismatched -that’s quasi clever - you said something but you said nothing
07/09/2025, 12:40 - onur: And the top 20 is getting invaded by refugee hordes
07/09/2025, 12:40 - +44 7446 051842: I wouldn’t say the places where the prisoners dilemma is overcome is drawn on borders as much as it is drawn on rooms.
07/09/2025, 12:40 - onur: What
07/09/2025, 12:41 - Will-hazzer777: It is, "Nature, red in tooth and claw"
07/09/2025, 12:41 - +44 7446 051842: Every country has dog eat dog, and vulnerable places.

07/09/2025, 12:41 - onur: So the line suggests that the conditions under which people manage to overcome the prisoner’s dilemma and cooperate aren’t at the scale of nations or large populations, but rather at the scale of small, intimate spaces where trust, reputation, and direct interaction can form
07/09/2025, 12:41 - onur: I meant to reply this
07/09/2025, 12:42 - +44 7958 612614: doh, more people = more difficult to cohere / align
07/09/2025, 12:42 - onur: So you are saying if everyone cleaned in front of their door the world would be clean
07/09/2025, 12:42 - onur: 😅
07/09/2025, 12:43 - +44 7446 051842: Those small spaces often weave into a network, but those networks often don’t mesh neatly onto a border.
07/09/2025, 12:43 - onur: What about
07/09/2025, 12:43 - +44 7446 051842: Those networks can be bigger than nations.
07/09/2025, 12:43 - onur: 9/11
07/09/2025, 12:44 - onur: 😹
07/09/2025, 12:44 - +44 7446 051842: ‘Networks of friends exist.’
‘What about 9/11.’
07/09/2025, 12:44 - onur: Hahahaha
07/09/2025, 12:44 - onur: Yeah that network of friends did 9/11
07/09/2025, 12:44 - onur: And resulted into borders getting even more materialised
07/09/2025, 12:44 - onur: When u think about it
07/09/2025, 12:45 - +44 7446 051842: That very same network of friends probably experienced 9/11.
07/09/2025, 12:45 - onur: Downward causality
07/09/2025, 12:45 - Will-hazzer777: Since increasing urbanisation since the 1950s... The environmental adaptions that have made are typically educational. Things like teaching children "Stranger Danger" etc... it is many children's natural inclination to talk to people and engage with them... To them everyone is new, whether in a traditional community or in a transient environment. However, in transient urban environments where people don't know eachother and there's little or no accountability, this is more problematic. As such teaching children not to readily interact with strangers is necessary. That's an environmental adaptation to solve an evolutionary mismatch.
07/09/2025, 12:46 - +44 7446 051842: Maybe we should create a society where strangers are less dangerous. <This message was edited>
07/09/2025, 12:47 - Will-hazzer777: Well it probably requires doing psychological assessments before they're put in the same cage as the rest of us... But that's rarely done.
07/09/2025, 12:48 - +44 7446 051842: What are our thoughts on a global government with power over individual states.
07/09/2025, 12:49 - Will-hazzer777: We're quite good at not putting dangerous individuals in with other animals when it comes to housing zoo creatures... But we don't afford the same courtesy to ourselves....
07/09/2025, 12:49 - Will-hazzer777: Perhaps it's evolutionary for the best... It speeds up the process of getting rid of the weak libtards.
07/09/2025, 12:49 - Parag-meetup: Sorry 

Let’s discuss this 

So were the consequences desired , and which principles did they not match up with
07/09/2025, 12:50 - +44 7446 051842: As an immigrant I assure you I am going to take all of your shit and sleep with all of your women. Is that what you reckon?
07/09/2025, 12:50 - +44 7446 051842: There is no ‘best’ in evolution.
07/09/2025, 12:51 - Parag-meetup: @⁨Will-hazzer777⁩ is the immigrant
07/09/2025, 12:51 - +44 7446 051842: What in the friendly fire.
07/09/2025, 12:52 - +44 7958 612614: I wonder why the research points at most crimes and violence perpetrated by people closest to you?  

🔹 Global picture (WHO, UN, CDC, EU surveys)

The majority of violence against women comes from intimate partners, not strangers.

WHO global estimate (2018):

1 in 3 women (≈ 30%) experience physical and/or sexual violence in their lifetime.

Of these, most violence is by intimate partners.

About 27% of women aged 15–49 report such violence by a current or former partner.

UNODC (2019, “Global Study on Homicide: Gender-related killing of women and girls”):

Women are far more likely to be killed by an intimate partner or family member than by a stranger.

In fact, about 58% of female homicide victims were killed by partners or relatives (compared to ~20% of men).
07/09/2025, 12:52 - +44 7446 051842: I got to go write and essay, I’ll be back.

07/09/2025, 12:53 - Parag-meetup: Came on a dingy
07/09/2025, 12:53 - +44 7958 612614: that’s his better half...
07/09/2025, 12:53 - Parag-meetup: On what
07/09/2025, 12:53 - +44 7446 051842: Should their be a global government with power over individual states.
07/09/2025, 12:53 - +44 7446 051842: I say yes, like an American model.
07/09/2025, 12:54 - +44 7446 051842: With even more dissolution of power downwards.
07/09/2025, 12:54 - Parag-meetup: Agree
07/09/2025, 12:54 - +44 7958 612614: centralisation all the way...
07/09/2025, 12:54 - +44 7446 051842: No.
07/09/2025, 12:54 - +44 7958 612614: much better to have corruption only at the top then as cancer throughout the society
07/09/2025, 12:55 - +44 7958 612614: confederation - the worst thing - it’s a half-way hope
07/09/2025, 12:55 - +44 7446 051842: Workplace democracy and unionization would be far more efficient than socialism.
07/09/2025, 12:55 - +44 7446 051842: It’s the best thing
07/09/2025, 12:55 - +44 7958 612614: democracy as a paradigm is already on the way out
07/09/2025, 12:55 - Parag-meetup: However there should be a few isolated states left out of this , as controlled experiments
07/09/2025, 12:55 - +44 7446 051842: Democracy is robust.
07/09/2025, 12:56 - +44 7958 612614: there’s no kick starting it - direct democracy doesn’t solve any of the inherent problems of parlamentary demoracy
07/09/2025, 12:56 - +44 7446 051842: Yeah fuck Angola, they’re not allowed in super heaven.
07/09/2025, 12:56 - +44 7958 612614: off to pop some corn
07/09/2025, 12:56 - +44 7446 051842: Praise to the Swiss model.
07/09/2025, 12:56 - Parag-meetup: That’s a fallacy 

You can’t equate centralisation with corruption
07/09/2025, 12:56 - +44 7958 612614: are yo from SA>
07/09/2025, 12:56 - +44 7958 612614: ?
07/09/2025, 12:57 - +44 7446 051842: Am I from sexual assault? What kind of question is that. (Joke.)
07/09/2025, 12:57 - +44 7958 612614: no - centralisation just means more hierarchical
07/09/2025, 12:58 - Parag-meetup: You give opinions , and use them as explanations , whist not explaining them at all 

Your opinions and speculations are not facts
07/09/2025, 12:58 - Will-hazzer777: Anyone in their right mind if they know they have a neighbour who is a bully and they can't move house, will do their best not to irritate their neighbour... However the Ukrainians irritated their neighbour on purpose by ganging up on them with the rest of their neighbours.

Their neighbour who is the bully invades their back garden as a consequence. Instead of climbing down from the situation and admitting defeat early on, to get their back garden back, on principle, without thinking about the long term consequences and likelihood of success they have continued to be belligerent and not admit defeat. As a consequence they are likely to lose their house as well.

The pragmatic thing to do would have not to have been to gang up on their neighbour with the rest of the neighborhood but subsequently to that it would have been to admit defeat early in a war you know you cannot win.
07/09/2025, 12:58 - +44 7958 612614: opinions cannot be facts.  What are you on about??
07/09/2025, 12:58 - Parag-meetup: More like Singapore
07/09/2025, 12:58 - +44 7958 612614: if only the world could be explained in simple algebra - you’d probaby get it then
07/09/2025, 12:58 - Parag-meetup: Not a fan of direct democracy 
Totally against it actually
07/09/2025, 12:59 - Parag-meetup: Some people are
07/09/2025, 12:59 - +44 7958 612614: Let him speak!!! (I just sat down)
07/09/2025, 12:59 - onur: Do you have like 10 different sentences in your keyboard and you press them depending on the situation?
07/09/2025, 12:59 - onur: Example 2
07/09/2025, 12:59 - onur: 😂
07/09/2025, 12:59 - +44 7958 612614: for you i only have one
07/09/2025, 12:59 - Parag-meetup: Yes 

But that doesn’t necessarily mean corruption
07/09/2025, 13:00 - Will-hazzer777: There is bad, worse and worst, and good, better and best... The worst go extinct.
07/09/2025, 13:00 - +44 7958 612614: that’s the most effective way of dealing with fools - just give them standard sentances from a relatively small pool and they’ll love it
07/09/2025, 13:00 - +44 7958 612614: that’s what Trump does
07/09/2025, 13:01 - +44 7446 051842: Is ought problem.
07/09/2025, 13:01 - +44 7958 612614: but who goes extinct?  That’s the way for life to go on - so every evolution is good
07/09/2025, 13:01 - Parag-meetup: All of what you said is wrong

But not interested in facts here 

Talking about long term consequences and principles 

What principles did they follow 
And what consequences should they have hoped for ?
07/09/2025, 13:01 - +44 7516 029853: We already changed our biology, not too much, though
07/09/2025, 13:02 - Parag-meetup: Shame
07/09/2025, 13:02 - Parag-meetup: Such a limitation
07/09/2025, 13:02 - onur: Oh yeahh another Alex joins the party
07/09/2025, 13:02 - +44 7516 029853: Yeah, welcome @⁨~Alex⁩ !
07/09/2025, 13:03 - Will-hazzer777: It's not, as a human being you potentially have the adaptability to see something is likely before it happens... you're not just wandering the world as an automaton acting purely on on instinct.

07/09/2025, 13:07 - onur: Why
07/09/2025, 13:07 - +44 7516 029853: since I can type whatever I want I exercise that power.

like a mini-God
07/09/2025, 13:12 - +44 7516 029853: This reminds me of something that happened a few days ago. I was playing a game where you have to guess a word based on a drawing. I wrote down five options, and someone said, ‘Oh, I thought it had to be just one word.’ That puzzled me a bit, because really, who is going to stop me from writing five if I change my mind while guessing?
07/09/2025, 13:12 - Will-hazzer777: They have been goaded by their leader and our leaders and the MSM... To act on principle... I.e. you must stand up to bullies whatever the consequences... You must never give in... You must never negotiate with terrorists etc.... they're all principles... When taken to the extreme they can be very detrimental when you know you are the weaker party. 

If you don't know you the weaker party are and all your friends goad you on and tell you can 'have' that that mean bad bully... That's really dangerous... It's better to just live another day and walk away.

Instead the Ukrainians have fallen for peer pressure and the principles of their peers... And they're they ones having to face the consequences of that.

It's sort of why we tell people, when someone mugs you, don't fight for your phone or wallet or whatever... The likelihood is that it's not worth the consequences i.e. getting stabbed and killed... You might want to fight out of principle... but it's better to hand the stuff over or let it go and don't chase the mugger for your stuff.

If you had been better prepared, didn't do certain things or didn't go in particular locations, you wouldn't have been mugged in the first place. However, now that you have been... Don't be stupid.
07/09/2025, 13:16 - Parag-meetup: You are talking about short term principles 

What’s their long term principle and outcome ? 

Philisophy 

To be independent? 

Mainly because they don’t believe in the philosophy of Russia 

And align more with Western European philosophy 

It’s east vs west europium philosophy clash .

Other wise being a part of Russia would certainly serve them better . 

But none of the states don’t wanna be part of Russia , even Belarus 

While almost everyone wants to be part of Europe ( barring uk ) .. is a measure of success of philosophies
07/09/2025, 13:17 - +44 7516 029853: Sad to admit, but it's quite reasonable.
Receive my like
07/09/2025, 13:17 - Parag-meetup: And going by that measure 

Putting those principles above personal short term gain , they have decided to go on with this war 
( it is sold to a lot of people as nationalism , standing up to bullies ) but the underlying final principle is a difference in philosophy
07/09/2025, 13:20 - Parag-meetup: At some point in life you decide , that you only live for 90 odd years at most . What you leave for the future generations is more important . 

It is what an existential risk it , it’s not a personal existence , it’s a philosophical existence
07/09/2025, 13:20 - +44 7516 029853: And here I will make a correction.
Most revolutions are led by young people, not those who see their legacy
07/09/2025, 13:21 - +44 7516 029853: That includes revolutions (and attempts) in Moldova, Ukraine and Belarus
07/09/2025, 13:21 - +44 7516 029853: The recent and old ones
07/09/2025, 13:22 - Will-hazzer777: Unfortunately it's a zero sum game when the consequences of

'short term actions'

Match

'long term principles'

"And what do you benefit if you gain the whole world but lose your own soul?"

Matt 16:26

If you die in the short term from actions that stem from trying to secure long term goals... 

Then you neither live nor secure your goals. <This message was edited>

So many fallacies is this statement , that it’s not even worth a cursory read
07/09/2025, 13:24 - Will-hazzer777: That's what people say when they have nothing to come back with.
07/09/2025, 13:24 - Parag-meetup: Ya I agree , but I didn’t mean , age as in some point in your life , 

But a particular circumstance and time when it happens
07/09/2025, 13:25 - Will-hazzer777: It is a difference in philosophy.... One that going to obliterate Ukraine as a country.
07/09/2025, 13:27 - Parag-meetup: That’s an assumption 

But yes , better no country than a country with the opposite philosophy
07/09/2025, 13:27 - Parag-meetup: The hope is that’s there will be a thriving country with the Philisophy that they want , if not now , then in a few decades
07/09/2025, 13:28 - +44 7958 612614: Independent from whom?  From anyone who’s not within their nation-state boundary?  the whole point of this war is to redraw the boundaries, so they do become independent - except that they’ll be sharing theri independence with Russia.  Crimea also wanted to be “independent”.  you just draw Ukranian borders around it and it’s independent. You draw Soviet borders around it - and it’s independent.
07/09/2025, 13:28 - Will-hazzer777: There won't be because there aren't going to be many Ukrainians left if any...
07/09/2025, 13:30 - Will-hazzer777: When you obliterate yourself in the process of trying to be independent.... the only thing you become independent of is life itself.
07/09/2025, 13:36 - Parag-meetup: Keep themselves independent 
Basically not part of Russia 
They woudl gladly be part of France or Germany
07/09/2025, 13:36 - Will-hazzer777: I think the motto of ,

"live to fight another day" a better motto than... 

"Fight and die now than live in a tomorrow not completely of your making"
07/09/2025, 13:36 - Parag-meetup: That’s your assumption and speculation
07/09/2025, 13:37 - Parag-meetup: That’s just foolish word play with no real meaning 

As I said better to have no country than a country with the phisliojy you believe is wrong
07/09/2025, 13:37 - Will-hazzer777: It isn't, I've demonstrated the demographics of Ukraine enough to show that they're in a death spiral they're not going to get out of.
07/09/2025, 13:37 - Parag-meetup: Yes a lot of people without morals and principles do that
07/09/2025, 13:37 - Will-hazzer777: Well it's better to be alive than dead... That's what I think.
07/09/2025, 13:38 - Parag-meetup: Huh ? 
As in the professor or Ukraine and magical soothsayer
07/09/2025, 13:38 - Will-hazzer777: Morals are a matter of opinion.
07/09/2025, 13:38 - Will-hazzer777: Yes
07/09/2025, 13:38 - Parag-meetup: Yes 
Absolutely for you 

Your interest matters most 

For others their principles and philosophy matters most 

However in long term the latter thrive
07/09/2025, 13:39 - Parag-meetup: Anyways not here to bicker with you
07/09/2025, 13:39 - Parag-meetup: Especially on the fun and pun group
07/09/2025, 13:39 - Will-hazzer777: Each to their own my friend... My intention hasn't been to convince others to follow my lead... Just to point out what I see as their folly. Though I know they won't change their ways.
07/09/2025, 13:40 - Will-hazzer777: It always fun 😉
07/09/2025, 13:40 - Parag-meetup: Why would you point out others folly if you don’t want them to correct it ? 

Does it give you pleasure to make people feel miserable ? Is that it
07/09/2025, 13:41 - Will-hazzer777: Yes it does... Because I think it's fun to point it out.
07/09/2025, 13:41 - Will-hazzer777: It brings me joy and satisfaction

Hope you don't take it as an offence - that's not my intention.
07/09/2025, 15:50 - Will-hazzer777: I don't take offense no and it's not my intention to provide any though... It's just a head in hands situations that I see.

07/09/2025, 19:55 - +353 89 605 0161: There's loads a videos of doctors performing these kinds of intimate operations online.
Although I do see the doctors in other videos so I think they also side hustles as plumbers, pizza delivery guys etc... 🤔

07/09/2025, 22:15 - +44 7516 029853: Tbh, I looooove lighthouses, not boats (yet).

They're two of them in that spot. So that's why.

08/09/2025, 10:17 - onur: Missed it I guess sorry
08/09/2025, 10:18 - Will-hazzer777: ☝️
08/09/2025, 10:19 - Will-hazzer777: You just have to be careful who you sit next to.
08/09/2025, 10:19 - Will-hazzer777: Or in front of.
08/09/2025, 10:22 - onur: Yeah but still
08/09/2025, 10:22 - onur: What does it say about me or racism that I am staying away from black people in public :D
08/09/2025, 10:23 - onur: Especially at public transportation
08/09/2025, 10:29 - Will-hazzer777: That's not what I was saying... There's a lot of individuals that look sketchy... And the best thing is to stay away from vagabonds of all stripes who at least look shady or look disturbed.

However my theory is that some people, like many refugees from Ukraine are naive, because many come from small little places where they never got much exposure to a wide selection of sketchy type people, especially the type who live in big cities.
08/09/2025, 10:33 - onur: What does it have to with naivety
08/09/2025, 10:33 - onur: She just took a seat in public transport
08/09/2025, 10:36 - +44 7958 612614: very measured responses.  Some people challenged his policies, awkward at times.
08/09/2025, 10:38 - Will-hazzer777: When I get on a bus, I look around who I might or might not sit next to. You get a sixth sense from experience of who might or might not cause you trouble. Who might or might not kick up a fuss or a stink or who might just be a bit out of the heads.

A lot of people who new to a place or culture are naive and don't have the experience to pick up on the subtle signs and tells. That's why tourists are targeted because they're naive, they can't tell scams or local facial expressions or behaviours when someone is up to no good. <This message was edited>
08/09/2025, 10:38 - +44 7958 612614: is that not why people suffer harm usually??  Wrong time, wrong place.  Are you re-inventing it?
08/09/2025, 10:39 - +44 7958 612614: you two either need a bodyguard or just spend your last days at home
08/09/2025, 10:41 - +44 7958 612614: or anti-anxiety drugs
08/09/2025, 10:42 - Will-hazzer777: Partly, but also lack of experience of seeing stuff in people's behaviours or manner that are particular to a local area that people who are from there can see, but you can't...

It's like scams abroad... Western tourists get trapped by them because they're purported with smiles and salutations. Western people aren't used to that kind of scam because that's not how western swindlers operate.
08/09/2025, 10:43 - Will-hazzer777: I just know when to get off a carriage and into another carriage when I feel uncomfortable.
08/09/2025, 10:43 - +44 7958 612614: oh, you mean - must have been the wrong time or must have been the wrong place?  Oh, I get it…
08/09/2025, 10:44 - +44 7516 029853: Forwarding my old message:
So.
One day I was walking back home in London. A homeless person asked me for change, but I didn't give them money (I have no soul). Then he started shouting at me screaming "No one in this fucking city wants to help!!!". I was scared and later complained about the incident to friends. 
But then I remembered that in the New York subway, it's very popular to be a victim of a particular crime. Homeless people carry a lighter and a spray deodorant. They ask you for money and make sure you can see their equipment (threatening to fire you on the spot). Very high success rate, don't remember even one story when they didn't get money. American social engineering 🔥🥲🫠 <This message was edited>
08/09/2025, 10:44 - +44 7958 612614: To change the place at the right moment you mean, oh I get it now <This message was edited>
08/09/2025, 10:44 - Will-hazzer777: They don't know it's the wrong time or place or person... I.e. they're naive...
08/09/2025, 10:45 - +44 7958 612614: you mean, like all people who suffer harm - now it’s all crystallising
08/09/2025, 10:45 - Will-hazzer777: It's easier on a train...

But on a bus, I tend to go to the top deck... But it depends.
08/09/2025, 10:46 - Will-hazzer777: Some people know... It's just that they inadvertently found themselves in the wrong part of town with the wrong company.
08/09/2025, 10:46 - +44 7958 612614: access to lighters should be restricted, then they can spray to their hearts delight
08/09/2025, 10:47 - +44 7958 612614: jeez 🙁
08/09/2025, 10:47 - +44 7958 612614: nobody willingly finds themselves in the harm’s way
08/09/2025, 10:48 - Will-hazzer777: That's why it's either inadvertent or due to naivety.
08/09/2025, 10:48 - +44 7958 612614: yep, wrong place, wrong time
08/09/2025, 10:48 - Will-hazzer777: It's mostly wrong company...
08/09/2025, 10:49 - +44 7958 612614: and wrong company is located spatially and temporally
08/09/2025, 10:49 - +44 7958 612614: T-rex is a wrong company
08/09/2025, 10:49 - +44 7958 612614: also Al Capone
08/09/2025, 10:50 - +44 7958 612614: just don’t use public transport.  Forest Gump ran everywhere
08/09/2025, 10:50 - Will-hazzer777: Wrong company can happen anyway... But more likely at bad times (after chucking out time) and wrong places... Like late night public transport.
08/09/2025, 10:50 - +44 7958 612614: or live in a remote place
08/09/2025, 10:50 - Will-hazzer777: Wrong business park.
08/09/2025, 10:50 - +44 7958 612614: no, it’s impossible to find a shark in a swimming pool, for example
08/09/2025, 10:51 - Will-hazzer777: Far away?
08/09/2025, 10:51 - Will-hazzer777: It isn't impossible...
08/09/2025, 10:51 - +44 7958 612614: no, just make sure nobody exists where you are - how much space do you need?
08/09/2025, 10:51 - Will-hazzer777: One Epstein island
08/09/2025, 10:52 - +44 7958 612614: oh, I see - some people are naive and get eaten by sharks in swimming pool, you’re not stupid - they’ll never get you
08/09/2025, 10:52 - Will-hazzer777: They swim up the gutters
08/09/2025, 10:52 - +44 7958 612614: they get picked up by hurricanes and dropped from the sky
08/09/2025, 10:53 - Will-hazzer777: It's like it's not impossible to have snakes on a plane either.

08/09/2025, 11:10 - +44 7516 029853: I remember getting lost in SF because I thought I knew better than Google Maps.
It was showing me a long route, but I decided to go straight through Tenderloin (not knowingly) 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenderloin,_San_Francisco
08/09/2025, 11:10 - +44 7516 029853: I was the only white girl there, there were people lying on the ground
08/09/2025, 11:10 - +44 7516 029853: And I was the alien, not them
08/09/2025, 11:12 - onur: How was it
08/09/2025, 11:12 - +44 7516 029853: I ended up alright, I guess that is because I was not naive 😆
08/09/2025, 11:12 - onur: Can u describe more <This message was edited>
08/09/2025, 11:13 - onur: Did people approach u or smth?
08/09/2025, 11:13 - +44 7516 029853: I swear, it was dozens of people who were clearly under serious drugs. Just lying on the ground (not one or two people, dozens), like a zombie apocalypse movie. <This message was edited>
08/09/2025, 11:14 - +44 7516 029853: They were absolutely shocked to see me there. I guess that is the only reason I was ok
08/09/2025, 11:14 - +44 7516 029853: I never have seen anything like that before and after (not looking forward).
08/09/2025, 11:15 - +44 7516 029853: I was panicking, but was acting reserved, just walking as fast as I could
08/09/2025, 11:16 - +44 7958 612614: did you project power like a lobster?
08/09/2025, 11:17 - +44 7958 612614: what one should never do is make an eye contact
08/09/2025, 11:17 - +44 7516 029853: Abosultely! Deer power
08/09/2025, 11:17 - +44 7958 612614: and be aware of what’s going on
08/09/2025, 11:18 - +44 7958 612614: situation cannot develop if there are no steps leading to it.  There is always an escalation.

08/09/2025, 11:21 - onur: There is a similar drug in turkey
08/09/2025, 11:21 - onur: People stay still or bend in weird positions like zombies
08/09/2025, 11:22 - onur: I used it for 2 years it is hard to get off, they are probably using it because it keeps u warm and detached from the reality of their current situation
08/09/2025, 11:24 - +44 7516 029853: I also remember at some point seeing the police, and I will admit, I hoped they would help me get out of there (I can't fight 😞). I approached the police, said I was lost and needed help, and the reply was
 - yeah, it will be as tough as it was for another 2 blocks, but someone was just killed, so we should go
At least they said where the closest way out is
08/09/2025, 11:24 - onur: I have read there is a philipino gang in there
08/09/2025, 11:25 - +44 7958 612614: what type of music do they play?
08/09/2025, 11:25 - onur: I dont like the police
08/09/2025, 11:25 - onur: Idk
08/09/2025, 11:25 - +44 7516 029853: Is it popular in Turkey bcs it is incredibly cheap? I actually can't imagine how those people afford drugs. Even pints are expensive
08/09/2025, 11:26 - onur: Yeah it is “spice”
08/09/2025, 11:26 - onur: Alcohol and weed and other drugs are expensive so people turn to these shit
08/09/2025, 11:27 - onur: You can get absolutely destroyed for 2 hours for 50 penny whereas for a pint theyd have to pay like 5£
08/09/2025, 11:27 - +44 7516 029853: I did not say I like them by default (though I live with one lol), but I still think I am better off asking for help when I am lost, instead of screaming ACAB while being in Tenderloin. 
Call me weak, I call it being strategic.
08/09/2025, 11:27 - onur: And 1 pint doesnt do shit
08/09/2025, 11:27 - onur: Who are you living with?
08/09/2025, 11:28 - onur: Hahahaha
08/09/2025, 11:28 - onur: Lool
08/09/2025, 11:28 - +44 7516 029853: A detective! But she was a policewoman
08/09/2025, 11:28 - onur: Nice one
08/09/2025, 11:28 - onur: Does she tell stories?
08/09/2025, 11:28 - +44 7516 029853: Yes, but rarely.
08/09/2025, 11:28 - +44 7958 612614: does she let you wear the uniform?
08/09/2025, 11:29 - +44 7516 029853: She was promoted, so she has no uniform. But she was a patrol policewoman for many years before she became a detective.
08/09/2025, 11:40 - +44 7516 029853: I have another silly story (two), but another one for later.
I was in Moscow, just had a huge fight with my (now ex) boyfriend and ran into the subway. While there, I started crying (I was a teen, so no shame!). A policeman approached me and asked what was wrong. I said I had a fight with my boyfriend, and the guy gave me a pack of napkins, left me alone. 
For those who do not know the russian police, they are literally zombies. 
Maybe that was the only time in the history of the whole country, when a russian policeman did not commit a crime.
08/09/2025, 11:58 - Will-hazzer777: I'm sure the russian police are very law abiding... Towards russian law.
08/09/2025, 12:04 - +353 89 605 0161: Temple Bar in Dublin was like this the first time I went.
It's probably in the top three tourist attractions in Dublin. Small courtyard, the Temple Bar is famous for something (idk).

3 people passed out with syringes in their arms right in the middle of everyone else.

Then the same the next time I went.
08/09/2025, 12:04 - onur: How come?
08/09/2025, 12:04 - onur: Why would you do heroin in a bar?
08/09/2025, 12:05 - +353 89 605 0161: Nah, the whole square is named after the bar.
So temple bar is a pub and also the courtyard outside it
08/09/2025, 12:05 - onur: Oh got it now
08/09/2025, 12:07 - +353 89 605 0161: But the police have zero interest in dealing with them.
If someone calls, they just log it but never show up.

I don't know what they do show up for tbh

I miss pre Covid British police 😅

08/09/2025, 14:42 - +353 89 605 0161: Being unemployed is a full time job 😞
08/09/2025, 14:43 - onur: They didnt reply back

08/09/2025, 14:44 - onur: They said they are doing the logistics for the offer whatever the fuck is

08/09/2025, 15:07 - onur: Yeah though the thing is turkish people dont trust politician who lives in the western world
08/09/2025, 15:07 - onur: XD

08/09/2025, 15:24 - +44 7599 430972: The problem is that artist was unlicensed
08/09/2025, 15:24 - +44 7958 612614: he was using unsustainable paints
08/09/2025, 16:00 - +44 7516 029853: So! (I need a break anyway, so let’s talk about something depressing 😍)

There’s a worrying trend in both the UK and Ireland, where the economy is having a serious impact on every level of society.
The police are severely underfunded, and until about a decade ago, they at least had a decent pension to look forward to. Not anymore. As a result, they’re now facing a number of serious challenges:
1. Uninspiring salaries attract a small number of idealists, but mostly people who simply couldn’t find another job.
2. This leads to standards dropping below zero. There’s no physical examination test anymore (at least in Ireland), yet they are expected to follow “codified” rules of conduct, basically, they have no tools to deal with the public in most situations.
3. Crime rates are rising due to economic pressures, and prisons are already at full capacity. So even if someone needs to be prosecuted, the system can’t handle it, as there is simply no room in jails.

So now we are in this brilliant situation where the police have limited options, are not respected by the public and have minimal resources. They essentially have to prioritise who they help. Temple Bar clearly isn’t improving, so it makes no logical sense for them to waste their resources there.
08/09/2025, 16:01 - +44 7516 029853: I will repost here the message about the codified rules:
I recently discovered an interesting fact.
As some of you who have lived in Scotland or Ireland may know (in my personal experience, teens in London are not quite as roofless even in quite intense areas), certain groups of teenagers can be incredibly dangerous and seemingly without limits. So, the detective I mentioned above told me the Irish police were allowed to use "reasonable" physical force as a form of punishment against suspects (most often teenagers). This created a cycle in which, although formally prosecuting teens was (and still is) incredibly difficult, they were at least somewhat fearful of the police. 
In 2011, the "reasons" became "codified", which basically led to too many obstacles for the police, but not for the suspects. 
So, since 2011, the system has not only consistently failed to protect its citizens but also forbade the use of physical punishment, leaving police officers in a vicious cycle. Teenagers, well aware that there are unlikely to be serious consequences for their actions, often act with impunity.
08/09/2025, 16:04 - +44 7516 029853: P. S. jails are fucking expensive, which does not help the situation
08/09/2025, 16:05 - +44 7958 612614: it’s unhealthy when “customers” start rationalising bad service and empathising with lousy providers
08/09/2025, 16:06 - +44 7958 612614: things are rather simple - system either works or doesn’t.  It’s someone’s fault, inadequacy, incompetence, etc…. That’s a healthy approach which leads to remediation.  Everyone’s got a “valid” excuse.
08/09/2025, 16:08 - +44 7958 612614: and that’s exactly how the system works - nobody blames the police because they follow judiciary and judiciary somehow yields to democracy and democracy - well, that’s us.  So we have customer/provider and complicity/remediation paradox.  That’s pretty much teh essence behind teh  rise of authoritarianism in teh world - trying to escape the viscious circle of complexification and paralysis
08/09/2025, 16:09 - +44 7958 612614: but also, sometimes you have “innocent” managers forced to step down - and that’s healthy as well, even though it might seem a bit unjust on teh personal level
08/09/2025, 16:11 - +44 7516 029853: I am telling you the world is fucked. 
I am not validating its broken state but observing and explaining the complexity
08/09/2025, 16:11 - +44 7958 612614: and that’s pretty much why we’re going through this horrible period - the society and the systems and democracy have become incoherent and that cannot last because incoherence gives birth to opportunities (because nothing works like it should)
08/09/2025, 16:11 - +44 7958 612614: Amen 🙂
08/09/2025, 16:11 - +44 7958 612614: I’m not criticising you
08/09/2025, 16:11 - +44 7958 612614: I’m just pointing at a blindspot which is present everywhere
08/09/2025, 16:12 - +44 7958 612614: cognitive dissonance
08/09/2025, 16:50 - onur: Iasip new season episode 3
08/09/2025, 16:50 - onur: Is hilarious
08/09/2025, 16:50 - onur: They get hooked on microdosing very hot peppers 😂
08/09/2025, 16:53 - +353 89 605 0161: It starts and ends a lil weak but good middle I thought.
They lose what makes the show when they try to have any form of story/growth
08/09/2025, 16:54 - +353 89 605 0161: Except fat mac, that was good growth
08/09/2025, 17:05 - +353 89 605 0161: Need to land somewhere between where we are now and judge dredd
08/09/2025, 17:07 - +353 89 605 0161: It seems so backwards to me that teenagers get the kids gloves... Just when they're most malleable and perhaps the most salvageable.
08/09/2025, 17:08 - +353 89 605 0161: It's just an admission of a completely broken rehabilitation system, if it's better to keep criminal teenagers _out_ of the system...
08/09/2025, 17:08 - +44 7446 051842: Believe or not police officers should NOT physically punish children, who aren’t guilty of a crime?! <This message was edited>
08/09/2025, 17:09 - +44 7446 051842: Innocent until proven guilty?
08/09/2025, 17:09 - +44 7446 051842: This is the essence of justice.
08/09/2025, 17:10 - +44 7446 051842: I believe the police should get more funding and so should the prison system to make sure we vet and don’t hire racist psychos, and we can rehabilitate people. However giving the law more power to work outside of itself is dangerous.
08/09/2025, 17:11 - +353 89 605 0161: <Media omitted>
08/09/2025, 17:12 - +44 7446 051842: Smack ten kids, because one of them is a terrorist.
08/09/2025, 17:13 - +353 89 605 0161: It's even better because one of them is only a _suspected_ terrorist
08/09/2025, 17:14 - +44 7446 051842: I am a strong believer in prison abolition. (If you aren’t familiar with prison abolition theory please for the love of God don’t start a debate on it it’s so complicated to explain, we don’t just release all the murderers and rapists, we stop producing them.)
08/09/2025, 17:15 - +44 7958 612614: I simply believe that our justice and police should work for and keep people who abide by the rules and contribute to the system safe and happy.  Everything else is noise
08/09/2025, 17:16 - +44 7446 051842: I think our justice system should work for the people who don’t aswell.
08/09/2025, 17:16 - +44 7516 029853: While you are all poetic, I know that my shooting skills will be of great use in the foreseeable future. 
You can count on me (not everyone, though) ☺️
08/09/2025, 17:16 - +44 7446 051842: I don’t think someone should be shot for shoplifting, yes they may have broken the rules, but justice is important.
08/09/2025, 17:16 - +44 7958 612614: I think that Russian troops should work for Ukranian troops and vice versa.  Also, I believe that doctors should work for the patients and for the virus.
08/09/2025, 17:17 - +44 7446 051842: Refer to this example.
08/09/2025, 17:17 - +44 7958 612614: I think that car should drive forward and backwards at the same time., thus ensuring impartiality
08/09/2025, 17:17 - +44 7958 612614: Electricity should be self cancelling
08/09/2025, 17:17 - +44 7446 051842: Do you think someone should be executed for littering? <This message was edited>
08/09/2025, 17:18 - +44 7446 051842: If not, you want the justice system to work for the guilty aswell.
08/09/2025, 17:18 - +44 7958 612614: do you think someone should be drowned for reciting Shakespeare?
08/09/2025, 17:18 - +44 7446 051842: Do you want crooks to be rehabilitated before released, if so, you want the justice system to work for the guilty aswell. <This message was edited>
08/09/2025, 17:19 - +44 7958 612614: I just want them to stop littering - I don’t care about the noise
08/09/2025, 17:19 - +44 7958 612614: I just want them to stop hurting people, the rest is noise
08/09/2025, 17:19 - +44 7446 051842: So they should be executed, that would stop them? Is sparing them noise?
08/09/2025, 17:20 - +44 7446 051842: I guarantee you if we had a system like Singapore, no one would litter. <This message was edited>
08/09/2025, 17:20 - +44 7958 612614: well, I think you’re a bit too keen, but that’s your problem.  I just focus on the signal
08/09/2025, 17:20 - +44 7446 051842: Do you want public lashing? <This message was edited>
08/09/2025, 17:20 - +44 7446 051842: Justice needs to work for the sinners just as much!
08/09/2025, 17:20 - +44 7958 612614: Do you want toilet flush that will flush clean water with crap?
08/09/2025, 17:21 - +44 7958 612614: just like the car should drive forward as much as going backwards
08/09/2025, 17:21 - +44 7446 051842: In order to have an effective justice system, we need proportional response.
08/09/2025, 17:21 - +44 7446 051842: False analogy.
08/09/2025, 17:22 - +44 7446 051842: Proportion and correct sentencing require justice for the guilty.
08/09/2025, 17:22 - +44 7958 612614: how about not having effective justice and not having proportional response but just having justice and order?
08/09/2025, 17:23 - +44 7958 612614: I personally don’t care about “proportion” - I never woke up thinking - I wish there was more or better “proportion”.  It means nothing per se
08/09/2025, 17:23 - +44 7958 612614: “correct sentencing” - define correct that everyone would agree upon
08/09/2025, 17:24 - +44 7958 612614: and that’s why we have the notion of system boundaries so there are people inside and outside.  The system cares about its stakeholders, not about some other system’s stakeholders
08/09/2025, 17:24 - +44 7958 612614: but I’m now in a dangerous territory - I don’t want the likes of @⁨Will-hazzer777⁩  to start agreeing with me, so I'll reluctantly bow out
08/09/2025, 17:24 - +44 7446 051842: That a jury agree upon.
08/09/2025, 17:24 - +44 7446 051842: The guilty are also human.
08/09/2025, 17:25 - +44 7446 051842: If there was no proportion we would torture, rape and kill everyone who commits a crime.
08/09/2025, 17:25 - +44 7958 612614: what are you on about?  Like “jury” guarantees jusstice?  Just like democratic elections guarantee the “correct” choice.  Nazis got into power democratically.  So did Trump.  What’s your point?
08/09/2025, 17:25 - +44 7446 051842: That would stop crime.
08/09/2025, 17:25 - +44 7446 051842: Any better ideas?
08/09/2025, 17:25 - +44 7958 612614: right, now we only do that to people who don’t?
08/09/2025, 17:26 - +44 7446 051842: Infact you are very likely to get raped and killed in prison I’ll have you know.
08/09/2025, 17:26 - +44 7446 051842: This stops people from being rehabilitated.
08/09/2025, 17:26 - +44 7446 051842: Waste of labour, money, human life.
08/09/2025, 17:27 - +44 7958 612614: no, I have no better ideas, the point is that what you consider to be “worse” ideas are actually teh same.  Just like Chinese CP is not any worse than our democracy and different judiciaries and punishment paradigms, educational paradigms.  We are ideologically propagandised to think that we somehow have the right formula and everyone else doesn ’t.  Except that everyone else thinks the same. Do you not see the problem?
08/09/2025, 17:27 - +44 7958 612614: Why rehabilitate them and not prevent them in teh first place?  More fun?
08/09/2025, 17:28 - +44 7958 612614: am I very likely to end up in prison if I’m a positive contribution to the system and an abider of rules?
08/09/2025, 17:28 - +44 7446 051842: Ughyr Muslims?
08/09/2025, 17:28 - +44 7958 612614: and you’re talkoing about cognitive dissonance - just analyse your position
08/09/2025, 17:29 - +44 7958 612614: Were you compelled to say a random thing?
08/09/2025, 17:29 - +44 7446 051842: This is what prison abolition is, I support it. However we do need to recognise currently we need a plan.
08/09/2025, 17:29 - +44 7446 051842: Look it up.
08/09/2025, 17:30 - +44 7958 612614: No, you consider what you’re saying - Muslims that someone else oppresses are “good muslims” the ones that we oppress are “bad muslims” - anyway, i feel like you’ve used up your time, speak laterz
08/09/2025, 17:34 - +44 7446 051842: I don’t think the ones we oppress are bad Muslims.
08/09/2025, 17:34 - +44 7446 051842: I’m very aware of Islamaphobia being bad in Britian.
08/09/2025, 17:35 - +44 7446 051842: It’s just not genocide like Israel or China yet. <This message was edited>
08/09/2025, 17:37 - +44 7958 612614: we’re enabling the first one you mentioned, so indirectly we’re worse than the other country you mentioned.  I’m not even sure that there’s genocide in China - not that I researched it...
08/09/2025, 17:58 - +44 7446 051842: There is, look up Ughyr Muslims.
08/09/2025, 18:09 - +44 7958 612614: sure, 177 people who died is genocide, but 70k is not.  I’m not gonna argue this one.   during the Troubles (1969-2007), the British military was responsible for the deaths of approximately 301 to 366 people in Northern Ireland, with over half of these victims being unarmed civilians.  The Lancet (2006 survey) estimated approximately 654,965 excess Iraqi deaths through mid-2006 (95% CI: 392,979–942,636). About 601,027 were violent deaths, with 31% (≈ 186,318) attributed to the US-led coalition.   Like I said - believe what you will.
08/09/2025, 18:27 - +44 7446 051842: I believe 70K is also genocide.
08/09/2025, 18:28 - +44 7446 051842: Also we have no idea how many Ughyr have died, it’s ultra silenced.
08/09/2025, 18:28 - +44 7958 612614: the other figure is ultra transparent
08/09/2025, 18:28 - +44 7446 051842: It’s not a one up man ship game.
08/09/2025, 18:29 - +44 7958 612614: if you don’t know something - assume it’s there.  We don’t know how many people Switzerland regime has killed.  It’s ultra shrouded in mystery.  Maybe 1bn?
08/09/2025, 18:30 - +44 7958 612614: anyway, China is not beyond reproach, jsut like nobody else, but I think we’re past the straw man by now
08/09/2025, 18:31 - +44 7446 051842: I need you to look more deeply I to this issue, Ughyr persecution is very complex and shrouded in lies. 
However the Chinese CP is worse than democracy.
08/09/2025, 18:31 - +44 7446 051842: We don’t know how many people died in the Great Leap Forward.
08/09/2025, 18:31 - +44 7446 051842: Assume it’s none?
08/09/2025, 18:31 - +44 7446 051842: Or assume it’s low estimate at around 10 million?
08/09/2025, 18:31 - +44 7958 612614: and more importantly - we don’t know how many people didn’t die in the Great Leap Forward
08/09/2025, 18:32 - +44 7446 051842: I don’t believe in the black book of Communism but the numbers are still insane.
08/09/2025, 18:34 - +44 7958 612614: number of deaths during World War II range from 50 to 85 million people, making it the deadliest conflict in history.  Of course, if you “invent” distinction - than you can’t compare.  How can 85 million people who died in the war be compared to 10m who died in teh “Great Leap Forward”.  Those 10m are worth infinitely more!
08/09/2025, 18:34 - +44 7958 612614: and of course - ww2 is nothing to do with the West - it’s just a destinial throw
08/09/2025, 18:35 - +44 7958 612614: anyway, it’s all the same - just like the Chinese are served bullshit propaganda, so are we.  Just like Fox News consumers are served a pack of lies - so are the Guardian and New York Times readers
08/09/2025, 18:35 - +44 7958 612614: it’s naive to think otherwise
08/09/2025, 18:39 - +44 7446 051842: The 10 million is an extremely low estimate.
08/09/2025, 18:39 - +44 7446 051842: WW2 was from a lack of democracy not too much of it. <This message was edited>
08/09/2025, 18:39 - +44 7446 051842: I use ground news as a news factual comparative software. I’m almost outside that equation. <This message was edited>
08/09/2025, 18:40 - +44 7446 051842: Also those millions in China weren’t combatants.
08/09/2025, 18:41 - +44 7446 051842: If every news source reports the same lies, maybe I’m fucked.
08/09/2025, 18:41 - +44 7958 612614: right - so 10m is low estimate while ww2 is lack of democracy.  So you didn’t say what any. normal person would say 10m < 85m - you invented a narrative
08/09/2025, 18:41 - +44 7958 612614: no, they are different lies
08/09/2025, 18:41 - +44 7446 051842: What caused WW2?
08/09/2025, 18:41 - +44 7446 051842: If they are different lies, my software can pick up on it.
08/09/2025, 18:41 - +44 7958 612614: so people who don’t defend / fight - they are fair game?
08/09/2025, 18:42 - +44 7958 612614: what software?  are you doing some AI sensemaking?
08/09/2025, 18:42 - +44 7446 051842: It’s called ground news. It’s great.
08/09/2025, 18:42 - +44 7958 612614: people, not armadillos
08/09/2025, 18:42 - +44 7446 051842: What kind of societal organisation caused WW2, was it democracy?
08/09/2025, 18:43 - +44 7958 612614: ?? you’re looking for bite-size BBC style explainers.  That’s for pre-school kids.
08/09/2025, 18:43 - +44 7446 051842: Or arms build up, monarchy, aristocracy, Facism and Nazism.
08/09/2025, 18:43 - +44 7446 051842: Democracy wasn’t responsible for WW2 we didn’t vote to go to war.
08/09/2025, 18:43 - +44 7958 612614: wars are always teh same story - class of worldviews, perspectives and ideologies
08/09/2025, 18:43 - +44 7446 051842: There was no referendum.
08/09/2025, 18:44 - +44 7958 612614: you never vote to go to war.  No country votes to go to war.  Where did you get that from?
08/09/2025, 18:44 - +44 7599 430972: Wasn’t Hitler democratically elected?
08/09/2025, 18:44 - +44 7599 430972: He had war narratives before election
08/09/2025, 18:44 - +44 7446 051842: So if there is no vote there is no democracy.
08/09/2025, 18:44 - +44 7958 612614: that was bad democracy.  doesn’t count
08/09/2025, 18:44 - +44 7446 051842: If Hitler believed in democracy there would be no problem.
08/09/2025, 18:45 - +44 7446 051842: Democratic entropy can occur with not enough of it.
08/09/2025, 18:45 - +44 7958 612614: wow, really?  we live in parlamentary democracy - that type doesn’t organise referendums for every decision
08/09/2025, 18:45 - +44 7958 612614: he was populist - which means - he pandered to the people
08/09/2025, 18:45 - +44 7446 051842: We should live in a direct democratic society.
08/09/2025, 18:46 - +44 7446 051842: And parliament is closer to that goal, than the CCP.
08/09/2025, 18:46 - +44 7958 612614: that’s not gonna solve any issues.  It would just lock us into a paralysis and you’ll have different problems
08/09/2025, 18:46 - +44 7446 051842: Any better ideas?
08/09/2025, 18:46 - +44 7958 612614: rubbidsh - the main problem with democdracy is short electoral cycles.  So CCP is more strategic, democracy is more tactical.  Strategy always wins over tactics over large time periods.
08/09/2025, 18:47 - +44 7958 612614: but if you have long electoral cycles - then you approach CCP system
08/09/2025, 18:47 - +44 7599 430972: Albert Lebrun was also elected to represent a nation during war, similar to the way Roosevelt went to third term to be a “wartime president”
08/09/2025, 18:47 - +44 7446 051842: We shouldn’t have long electoral cycles because then you loose accountability.
08/09/2025, 18:48 - +44 7958 612614: yep, longer electoral cycles or leave politics and running of the country to people who want to do it - get qualified to it and rise up the party ladder.  Party is just an organisation that nurtures political thoughts and gets people ready to govern
08/09/2025, 18:48 - +44 7599 430972: Sounds like aristocracy
08/09/2025, 18:48 - +44 7446 051842: Where is the accountability?
08/09/2025, 18:49 - +44 7446 051842: People who don’t want to vote don’t have to.
08/09/2025, 18:49 - +44 7958 612614: the shorter electoral cycles the more going back and forth - while the more strategic  countries are running forward.  It’s simply unsustainable
08/09/2025, 18:49 - +44 7446 051842: The back and forth is what stop tyranny.
08/09/2025, 18:49 - +44 7958 612614: true, now we have it, so why lose it
08/09/2025, 18:49 - +44 7446 051842: Eventually morality wins.
08/09/2025, 18:50 - +44 7958 612614: wake up Camden - we have tyranny - what do yoiu think the States is and where it’s heading?  This is just the beginning.
08/09/2025, 18:50 - +44 7446 051842: Longer electoral cycles means it takes longer to hold people accountable.
08/09/2025, 18:50 - +44 7958 612614: yes, just like after war there’s always peace
08/09/2025, 18:50 - +44 7446 051842: I don’t want more.
08/09/2025, 18:50 - +44 7958 612614: so wars are good
08/09/2025, 18:51 - +44 7958 612614: the system should have built-in accountability - that’s CCP - Xi is the CCP servant - there’s an electoral process within
08/09/2025, 18:51 - +44 7958 612614: it’s just a different type of implementation
08/09/2025, 18:51 - +44 7446 051842: Built in acccountabilty doesn’t work if you are scrambling to suck up to those above you.
08/09/2025, 18:52 - +44 7516 029853: Wartime is not the time to secure elections. It can be used against the citizens, but if that is the case, it is not necessarily connected to the fact that there was a war in the first place - rather, it reflects the nature of the autocratic regime.
08/09/2025, 18:52 - +44 7958 612614: you mean like those tech leaders sucking up to trump - while sampling the delights of free democracy
08/09/2025, 18:52 - +44 7446 051842: Wartime is time to secure elections or countries with power hungry leaders will be in perpetual war.
08/09/2025, 18:53 - +44 7958 612614: democracy doesn’t exclude tyranny - just like single party system doesn’t exclude it.  Tehre’s no correlation.  We should look at comparable pros and cons.  But anyway, I’m pretty confident that we’re heading towards Chinese model - very reluctantly, but not much choice.  It works better at the moment.
08/09/2025, 18:53 - +44 7446 051842: In a couple years we can vote his party out if he listens to their praise. That’s the beauty.
08/09/2025, 18:54 - +44 7446 051842: Democracy holds tyranny to account.
08/09/2025, 18:55 - +44 7446 051842: Longer elections cycles means a lack of holding tyranny to account because they don’t have to prove anything to the public. <This message was edited>
08/09/2025, 18:55 - +44 7599 430972: No one has to prove anything to the public. Modern technology allows to prosecute and punish every protester
08/09/2025, 18:55 - +44 7958 612614: true, Hitler, Trump, Mussolini, Marcos, Erdogan, Orban, Mugabe - all stellar examples of how beautifully democracy prevents tyranny - probably anyone who wnats to become  a tyrant manages - democracy or not
08/09/2025, 18:56 - +44 7446 051842: Persecuting protesters is undemocratic.
08/09/2025, 18:56 - +44 7446 051842: Imagine how much worse if it never happened.
08/09/2025, 18:56 - +44 7446 051842: It only works because of FPTP.
08/09/2025, 18:56 - +44 7446 051842: And FPTP is undemocratic. <This message was edited>
08/09/2025, 18:56 - +44 7958 612614: but it happens in democracies  - so is undemocratic democracy democracy - now we’re engtering William’s territory - green party members not green party members
08/09/2025, 18:57 - +44 7446 051842: Happens a lot more in China.
08/09/2025, 18:57 - +44 7446 051842: Also what we call ‘democratic countries’ aren’t my democratic ideal.
08/09/2025, 18:57 - +44 7446 051842: They aren’t super democratic. UK and US have FPTP which I am against.
08/09/2025, 18:57 - +44 7516 029853: Yet somehow, in Ukraine, despite being in an active war, with 20% of its territory occupied and no elections held as a result, protests still occur and achieve tangible results. <This message was edited>
08/09/2025, 18:58 - +44 7446 051842: Ukraine is not a functional democracy.
08/09/2025, 18:58 - +44 7958 612614: no I can’t.  I don’t believe it would be any worse.  We had royals before democracy - not sure it was better or worse.  Napoleon wasn’t democratically elected and people were in support of hiim
08/09/2025, 18:58 - +44 7516 029853: Kinda. 
It is a very thin ice territory, though
08/09/2025, 18:59 - +44 7599 430972: Sometimes when I ask people to pay for my lunch they do, doesn’t mean that free food is an ask away
08/09/2025, 18:59 - +44 7446 051842: Not sure if monarchy was better or worse than democracy?!
08/09/2025, 18:59 - +44 7958 612614: it’s a myth and speculation that democracy stopped “tyrannts”.
08/09/2025, 18:59 - +44 7958 612614: You’re asking a question?
08/09/2025, 19:00 - +44 7446 051842: A monarch is sort of the ultimate tyrant!
08/09/2025, 19:00 - +44 7446 051842: Blood right to power.
08/09/2025, 19:00 - +44 7958 612614: Is Arabica better than Robusta (as in coffee)?  Is Sony better than Toshiba?
08/09/2025, 19:01 - +44 7958 612614: by definition or in reality?
08/09/2025, 19:01 - +44 7516 029853: I do not think your example follows the logic of my example. 
In that case, war = can't have elections, but can have protests, as the country is young but democratic. 
And yours is pure life drama. <This message was edited>
08/09/2025, 19:02 - +44 7446 051842: By definition.
08/09/2025, 19:02 - +44 7958 612614: oh, you have a principled objection to it, so it’s worse than someone actually doing bad things.  By definition monarch is worse - even though they are benign and caring for their peopel
08/09/2025, 19:02 - +44 7516 029853: We do not allow people under 10 to vote, yet still have elections
08/09/2025, 19:02 - +44 7958 612614: you see - this argument is turning into discussion about WORDS not about THINGS
08/09/2025, 19:03 - +44 7446 051842: Kind of a philosophy chat but I digress.
08/09/2025, 19:03 - +44 7446 051842: Monarchs also have done terrible shit.
08/09/2025, 19:03 - +44 7516 029853: Yes, however, the way we understand words defines our understanding of things.
08/09/2025, 19:03 - +44 7446 051842: British Raj?
08/09/2025, 19:03 - +44 7958 612614: i’m taking notes.  Glad for any knowledge I can scoop.
08/09/2025, 19:03 - +44 7599 430972: Just because something happened doesn’t mean that will always happen. For sure governments can listen to protests for whichever reason - they are weak, agree with protesters or want their minds somewhere else. Doesn’t mean that if governments want to stay in power forever and squash the protests they cannot do so with modern technology
08/09/2025, 19:04 - +44 7958 612614: and the way we use our words defines the interpretation of reality
08/09/2025, 19:05 - +44 7516 029853: <Media omitted>
08/09/2025, 19:05 - +44 7446 051842: Would you rather be a slave in Rome with a better quality of life than a free man in Corinth. Or a free man in Corinth.
08/09/2025, 19:05 - +44 7958 612614: yep, because they are people and it’s people who do terrible stuff.  Not systems - people commission and run systems - that’s still people - not systems, not regimes - that’s just metaphor swapping
08/09/2025, 19:05 - +44 7599 430972: I actually believe this is not so straightforward
08/09/2025, 19:05 - +44 7446 051842: They get away with it, because they are monarchs.
08/09/2025, 19:06 - +44 7958 612614: I dont’ want to argue with you - i consider you to be a friend 😜
08/09/2025, 19:06 - +44 7599 430972: It’s a fallible argument to begin with - measuring amount of suffering system or democracy/autocracy produced
08/09/2025, 19:06 - +44 7599 430972: It’s like evaluating how much harm was done by NHS
08/09/2025, 19:07 - +44 7958 612614: no, they get away with it because of the dynamics of force
08/09/2025, 19:07 - +44 7599 430972: We will never know the control group
08/09/2025, 19:07 - +44 7516 029853: So, how does it contradict the fact that, on rare occasions, not having elections is justified? 
If you are breaking a leg and a doctor puts a cast on it, does it mean they want you to be enslaved? So any limits to be seen as breaking the democratic system?
08/09/2025, 19:07 - +44 7446 051842: Please argue with friends. It is good for you.
08/09/2025, 19:07 - +44 7446 051842: Ahem.
08/09/2025, 19:08 - +44 7599 430972: I’m not saying not having an election is unjust
08/09/2025, 19:08 - +44 7599 430972: Just saying public accountability is not a thing
08/09/2025, 19:08 - +44 7958 612614: anyone who has power can get away with things.  Some people have power but don’t abuse it, some people are stupid to understand how much power they have or are simply scared.
08/09/2025, 19:08 - +44 7446 051842: Ahem.
08/09/2025, 19:09 - +44 7958 612614: false dilemma
08/09/2025, 19:09 - +44 7446 051842: How come?
08/09/2025, 19:09 - +44 7958 612614: I don’t want to be any
08/09/2025, 19:09 - +44 7446 051842: If you had to choose.
08/09/2025, 19:09 - +44 7958 612614: I don’t want to choose - and if I had to choose - I’d start thinking about it
08/09/2025, 19:10 - +44 7516 029853: As a concept or what? 
I think you are occasionally skipping a layer of nuances, which is crucial.
I am sure you know and can give examples of cases of public accountability yourself
08/09/2025, 19:10 - +44 7446 051842: Answer the question honestly.
08/09/2025, 19:10 - +44 7958 612614: these subjective hypothetical  scenarios are silly
08/09/2025, 19:10 - +44 7446 051842: It’s a philosphical experiment.
08/09/2025, 19:10 - +44 7446 051842: It’s useful.
08/09/2025, 19:10 - +44 7446 051842: Okay Jordan peterson.
08/09/2025, 19:11 - +44 7958 612614: how can I know ???  maybe as a slave in Rome I actually sleep with my mistress who happens to be the most beautiful woman in the Empire and live life of a king
08/09/2025, 19:11 - +44 7958 612614: you need to give me more data to work with
08/09/2025, 19:11 - +44 7958 612614: and  that’s the crux
08/09/2025, 19:11 - +44 7958 612614: if you give me enough data - your question willl become meaningless
08/09/2025, 19:11 - +44 7446 051842: Let’s say you have a better quality of life. Nicer clothes, nicer food, more food.
08/09/2025, 19:11 - +44 7446 051842: But you are a slave.
08/09/2025, 19:11 - +44 7958 612614: so - the vagueness of it is making it impossible to honestly evaluate
08/09/2025, 19:11 - +44 7446 051842: In Corinth you work as an apprentice.
08/09/2025, 19:11 - +44 7958 612614: I’m already a slave - I live with 4 women
08/09/2025, 19:12 - +44 7446 051842: You eat time to time, and you are a mason.
08/09/2025, 19:12 - +44 7446 051842: Which would you rather be.
08/09/2025, 19:12 - +44 7958 612614: we all eat time to time - nobody eats non-stop
08/09/2025, 19:12 - +44 7446 051842: You have two meals a day, let’s say.
08/09/2025, 19:12 - +44 7446 051842: Mostly porridge.
08/09/2025, 19:13 - +44 7446 051842: However you are a free man.
08/09/2025, 19:13 - +44 7958 612614: anyway - why don’t you ask someone else - where’s @⁨Parag-meetup⁩  - he loves engaging at that level
08/09/2025, 19:13 - +44 7958 612614: honestly, makes no difference to me - it’s just a label.  We’re never free or not free - we’re always on a sliding scale
08/09/2025, 19:14 - +44 7446 051842: Then that’s our philosophical bedrock difference.
08/09/2025, 19:14 - +44 7958 612614: maybe, I;m not a sucker for symbolism
08/09/2025, 19:15 - +44 7446 051842: You are unprincipled.
08/09/2025, 19:19 - +44 7958 612614: do I get a certificate or something?
08/09/2025, 19:54 - +353 89 605 0161: Better to reign in hell than serve in heaven?
08/09/2025, 19:58 - +44 7599 430972: Beef or chicken?
08/09/2025, 20:01 - +353 89 605 0161: Doesn't matter apparently 🤷‍♂
08/09/2025, 20:01 - +44 7958 612614: which cut?
08/09/2025, 20:01 - +44 7958 612614: chicken brisket or rib-eye?
08/09/2025, 20:03 - +44 7599 430972: Are you that principled!
08/09/2025, 20:06 - +44 7958 612614: more discerning than principled
08/09/2025, 20:16 - +44 7562 292419: Who was the worst philosopher to be remembered?
08/09/2025, 20:23 - +44 7958 612614: what does it mean worst?   Maybe it would be better to make a list of insightful philosophy and then discard the rest, but how?
08/09/2025, 20:23 - +44 7599 430972: me
08/09/2025, 20:24 - +44 7958 612614: how come we have 2 x ~Alex?
08/09/2025, 20:25 - +353 89 605 0161: Anyway, what I was going to say if Camden had bitten(!) was this slave with a nice life or freeman with a shit one is essentially this ☝️
And despite how attractive a character the one who says it is, they aren't supposed to be!
08/09/2025, 20:27 - +353 89 605 0161: I'm too inept to change my WhatsApp name and I'm weaponising that
08/09/2025, 20:30 - +44 7958 612614: and why not
08/09/2025, 20:31 - +44 7958 612614: but back to this - there’s so much philosophy that we haven’t been exposed to. -it’s almost by accident - someone recommends, etc..  There must be a lot of buried good philosophy that’s forgotten/supressed
08/09/2025, 20:33 - +44 7599 430972: Terrorist manifestos?
08/09/2025, 20:36 - +44 7958 612614: it’s a bit like Hollywood movies or english speaking movies - that’s all people get to see unless wins a prize at a major festival in the West

08/09/2025, 20:57 - +44 7516 029853: I had a neighbour with a hybrid breed cat  (a wildcat and a regular cat). They have a very cute tail, much softer than the usual one. 
It is actually a huge problem in Scotland, as most wildcats are hybrids, and can't properly function and hunt in the wild  ☹️
08/09/2025, 21:03 - +44 7958 612614: i wonder if any domestic cat dies in nature as a result of famine (temperate climes)
08/09/2025, 21:03 - +44 7958 612614: we take advantage of the neighbour’s cat - comes every day
08/09/2025, 21:03 - +44 7958 612614: she catches a mouse no probs
08/09/2025, 21:05 - +44 7958 612614: that’s her

08/09/2025, 21:05 - +44 7516 029853: Depends on the climate, I think.
They clearly can survive in nature and near cities, but I guess that's why hybrids do not live well in the harsh Scottish winter
08/09/2025, 21:06 - +44 7958 612614: yep, it’s cold there

08/09/2025, 21:11 - +44 7516 029853: I honestly developed a fear of Scottish forests because of that movie lol
08/09/2025, 21:12 - +44 7958 612614: why would you want to be in a scottish forest fear or no fear?
08/09/2025, 21:12 - +44 7958 612614: a lot of midges
08/09/2025, 21:13 - +44 7516 029853: I lived there. And people are into hikes in Scotland.
It is like a "hobby" for them

09/09/2025, 11:14 - +44 7516 029853: I mean at the time of her first job interview
09/09/2025, 11:14 - onur: It happened a month ago, she is 20 yo born in 2005
09/09/2025, 11:14 - onur: It was for an internship
09/09/2025, 11:16 - +44 7516 029853: I didn't have an interview for my first job, but it was an unusual one. I was singing in the main theatre's children's choir at the age of 15
09/09/2025, 11:16 - +44 7516 029853: It was cool, and the money they paid was alright for a teen

09/09/2025, 11:22 - +44 7516 029853: not much, have a friend doing this along modelling
09/09/2025, 11:23 - +44 7516 029853: but it is fun
09/09/2025, 11:50 - +44 7958 612614: what, like 15 an hour?
09/09/2025, 12:05 - +44 7516 029853: Quite often it is not even paid, but it helps building a portfolio and occasional network strengthening
09/09/2025, 12:10 - +353 89 605 0161: My dad runs life drawing classes and pays the models, idk how much.

I know that's the mainstream opinion but I don't really get why.
09/09/2025, 15:34 - +44 7958 612614: because they 1) want to hide it 2) don’t want to destroy it because  a) it’s worth money b) will be accused of cultural savagery
09/09/2025, 15:34 - +44 7958 612614: i mean - you’re disrespectful regularly of other people/cultures
09/09/2025, 15:34 - onur: I mean the flag represent things.
In the case of turkish flag the red represent the blood of martyrs during the turkish revolution
09/09/2025, 15:35 - onur: That is why
09/09/2025, 15:35 - +44 7958 612614: but poor people always get away 🙁
09/09/2025, 15:35 - +353 89 605 0161: Hotter than a flag pole without someone writhing around on it at least
09/09/2025, 15:35 - +44 7958 612614: jeez - you’re so deep today.  Flag represents things!!! Wow, what doesn’t represent something?
09/09/2025, 15:35 - +44 7958 612614: I’d ban flag poles and flags

09/09/2025, 15:36 - +353 89 605 0161: That doesn't explain why pole dancing is a disrespectful thing to do to it

09/09/2025, 15:37 - +44 7958 612614: it’s about identity politics
09/09/2025, 15:37 - +44 7958 612614: you identify with flag, someone doesn’t revere it as much - you take it personally
09/09/2025, 15:37 - +44 7958 612614: that’s why we have flags
09/09/2025, 15:37 - +44 7958 612614: so someone would be pushing them into your face <This message was edited>

09/09/2025, 15:47 - +353 89 605 0161: Your explaining the wrong bit.
I know why people might respect a flag.
I'm asking why people think pole dancing is disrespectful to something like that.
09/09/2025, 15:49 - +353 89 605 0161: Setting it on fire, sure that's an deliberate act of destruction and done for symbolic effect.
Trampling a flag is the same.

Those are actions with disrespect as the motive.

Pole dancing, to me, isn't a respectful or disrespectful act. It's respect neutral or something
09/09/2025, 15:50 - onur: Well “inappropriate purposes” is quite vague
09/09/2025, 15:50 - onur: So like islamists probably consider this kind of “erotic” looking dance as disrespect
09/09/2025, 15:51 - onur: But still even if it isn’t, there might be non islamist people who might think it is inappropriate to use it as a prop in a social media video
09/09/2025, 15:51 - +44 7958 612614: muslim society is pretty clear about the boundaries of decence.  Poll dancing probably falls faul
09/09/2025, 15:52 - onur: But yeah nevertheless prison is too much
09/09/2025, 15:52 - +44 7958 612614: Like - if your girlfriend spit on you (lol) you wouldn’t like it - but you don’t mind exchanging fluids while kissing
09/09/2025, 15:52 - +44 7958 612614: too much according to your gauge of punishment severity??
09/09/2025, 15:53 - onur: Yeah
09/09/2025, 15:53 - +44 7958 612614: it’s an arbitrary thing anyway - there must have been a consensus of some religious / legal scholars
09/09/2025, 15:53 - +44 7958 612614: I might think that the Sun shines too brightly <This message was edited>
09/09/2025, 15:54 - +44 7958 612614: Is today one of those days?? 😳
09/09/2025, 15:55 - onur: In my perception as an atheist its a little disrespectful
09/09/2025, 15:59 - +353 89 605 0161: How come though, like, what is it about pole dancing that's disrespectful though?
09/09/2025, 16:00 - +353 89 605 0161: Nah, this is the same as the Trampling or the burning. It has an intention and that makes it disrespectful.

Like, if someone spits when they talk you don't think they're disrespecting you if you catch a stray.
09/09/2025, 16:08 - +44 7958 612614: someone spitting at you inadvertently is not the same as climbing the flag pole and using it for pole dancing - that’s pretty deliberate.  I associate pole dancing with commercial sex (even though I’m not a prude in the slightest) - so they probably do too (and they are prudes)
09/09/2025, 16:12 - +44 7958 612614: Surprised no woman (and we have at least 3) has joined this fascinating convo <This message was edited>
09/09/2025, 16:15 - +353 89 605 0161: That's not my point about the act being deliberate or not. My point is the intention behind it.
If someone spits on you it's because they are trying to display disrespect to you.
Pole dancing isn't done with the intention to disrespect the pole they're dancing on. That's projected onto the act by, in this example, Turkish gov.
09/09/2025, 16:16 - +353 89 605 0161: They're busy scrubbing their social media accounts  for all the flag pole dancing they've done
09/09/2025, 16:17 - +44 7958 612614: lol, if only…. Pole dancing is a way of pushing your values across to someone who not only doesn’t agree about those values, but also doesn’t want to know.  They deem it harmful in a wider sense - like corrupting people.    You’re naive here.
09/09/2025, 16:18 - +44 7958 612614: You’re protecting the universe that you carefully curated - like you have a zen garden and someone comes there, plants potatoes and you wonder why they get upset <This message was edited>

09/09/2025, 16:20 - +353 89 605 0161: Ok this is actually answering my question now
09/09/2025, 16:20 - +44 7958 612614: Let’s say you’re at home, reading a book - a neighbour starts playing some weird music really loudly - they are not trying to offend you - but you on the receiving end find it objectable - they can make the same argument, that you’re being unreasonable, but they’re not taking into account your sensibilities
09/09/2025, 16:20 - +44 7958 612614: but do I need to spell it out - it’s bloody obvious
09/09/2025, 16:20 - +353 89 605 0161: We're on a philosophy chat lol
09/09/2025, 16:22 - +353 89 605 0161: But still not there
09/09/2025, 16:24 - +353 89 605 0161: They're offended by pole dancing cause they're prudes?
Tautology (again!)
09/09/2025, 16:25 - +44 7958 612614: @⁨~Alex⁩  - when I say empathy - I mean being able to see other people's perspectives without having enough information to do it faithfully.  Just imagine how would you, as someone who runs a Muslim country in that area or who's religious themselves - view this?
09/09/2025, 16:26 - +44 7516 029853: Woman here.
What do you want me to say? 
@⁨~Martin⁩
09/09/2025, 16:26 - +44 7958 612614: Anything you say - i’ll gobble up readily  😜
09/09/2025, 16:26 - +44 7516 029853: Pole dancing - commercialised sex: correct
09/09/2025, 16:27 - +44 7516 029853: Turkish "conservative" values clash with commercial sex: correct
09/09/2025, 16:27 - +353 89 605 0161: That's not what I have trouble with.
Im not surprised by this result, I'm trying to understand where the feeling comes from. Not the feeling itself.
09/09/2025, 16:28 - +44 7958 612614: You need to have the context of their society.  Why do certain people get annoyed when you “disrespect” or “diss” them?  It can’t be rationalised - it ties into beliefs, ego and social norms
09/09/2025, 16:28 - +44 7516 029853: Feel sorry for that girl. Jokes aside, she is being punished for something she probably knew would be highly controversial in a Mulsim-dominated country - fact

Still the punishment without a victim <This message was edited>
09/09/2025, 16:28 - +44 7958 612614: it comes from early work on your disposition which is - internalising the external - their external installed certain values and beliefs and they are now embodying them
09/09/2025, 16:29 - +44 7958 612614: yes, but it’s part of the value of the act - people would be giving her extra points for being so brave and daring
09/09/2025, 16:29 - +44 7958 612614: all risks can lead to opportunities or losses
09/09/2025, 16:30 - +44 7958 612614: but that’s life - you must engage with life because there’s nothing else
09/09/2025, 16:30 - +44 7958 612614: not like @⁨Will-hazzer777⁩  - who's actively tryhing to play it safe

09/09/2025, 16:36 - +44 7516 029853: Does not look like she left or could leave:
"The governor’s office confirmed the woman is under investigation for disrespecting the Turkish flag."
09/09/2025, 16:37 - +353 89 605 0161: 🤔 I wouldn't think that preclude her leaving.
Can investigate without having her in custody.
09/09/2025, 16:37 - +353 89 605 0161: It didn't say she'd been arrested, which is what I'd expect to be reading if she hadn't left already

09/09/2025, 16:39 - +44 7958 612614: pandering to the electorate, as usual - god bless democracy - you divorce foundational and performative
09/09/2025, 16:43 - +44 7516 029853: Here is my valuable contribution and summary:
The girl - likely very silly, but harmless
The flagpole - sad, lonely, but was not harmed
The Turkish government - 🤐
The potential punishment - makes little sense unless looking at it through the radical "values" perspective
The world - more and more conservative, does not appreciate expression enough, especially if it is connected to commercial dance outside of strip clubs
09/09/2025, 16:59 - +44 7958 612614: well the girl is harmless - the ideas that she can potentially put in teh heads of Turkish girls and boys - NOT HARMLESS

09/09/2025, 17:14 - +353 89 605 0161: _Why_ is pole dancing offensive?

That's the bloody question.
Therea nothing mysterious about a woman pole dancing in public to be getting in trouble in a Muslim country.

In asking _why_ are people offended by it. Why is it a boundary, what about it.

And saying, cause they're prudes or religious or whatever isn't an answer it's just saying the same thing.

There's some reason why that behaviour is seen as a threat to something and I wanted to know if anyone had any interesting take on what it's supposed to threaten.
09/09/2025, 17:22 - onur: So you are questioning why something is sacrilegious 

I think it is a subjective question depending on the cultural context and the values and the law in that country

So why is it offensive in this case is that people think it is inappropriate to use something representing the blood of martyrs with a sexual display 

Why sexual display is considered inappropriate? 

Why defecating on a flag is inappropriate? 

I mean its just a piece of fabric. It could be considered as like this and I would be ok with that but the cultural context and the law is not.

Same with quran burning.

Its just a piece of paper. So what? Well people get killed for it
09/09/2025, 17:23 - onur: Its 100% dependant on how u frame it

Its just a dance on a piece of fabric attached to a concrete pole
09/09/2025, 17:24 - onur: Or it is a disrespect to a national value and sacrifices of martyrs
09/09/2025, 17:29 - +44 7958 612614: why is anything offensive?
09/09/2025, 17:30 - +353 89 605 0161: > why sexual display is considered inappropriate
Yeah, this is what I'm after.
Like, the popular answer for this is usually "female sexuality is controlled... All religions sexist..." etc... That's the kinda answer reddit/Instagram would give.

But I'd say there'll be something more interesting from this group 🙃
09/09/2025, 17:30 - onur: Does anyone have a league of legends account that they dont use anymore?
09/09/2025, 17:31 - onur: It is what it is, some things are not deep.

Sacreligious comes from what you can or cannot do in a holy place
09/09/2025, 17:31 - onur: If you are asking that
09/09/2025, 17:31 - onur: And it probably reflected on other values <This message was edited>
09/09/2025, 17:32 - onur: Sex wasnt always sacrilegious
09/09/2025, 17:32 - +353 89 605 0161: Yeah.
So my quick answer is usually just, anything that threatens the authority of those in power gets drilled into the population as offensive. And then you gotta explain why it's a threat to the authority.

But I don't know if that's true of just sounds reasonable.
09/09/2025, 17:32 - onur: Its probably about abrahamic religions
09/09/2025, 17:38 - +44 7958 612614: social construct - it's just there, that's a fact
09/09/2025, 17:40 - +353 89 605 0161: "it's due to evolution"
Thats what you're doing to me rn Martin 😅
09/09/2025, 17:40 - +44 7958 612614: evolution mate, go for the safe bet
09/09/2025, 17:41 - +44 7958 612614: no, it's just there - ignore evolution <This message was edited>
09/09/2025, 17:42 - +353 89 605 0161: Now I'm _even more_ confused. A construct that is just there.
But it's a construct, it must have been built
09/09/2025, 17:42 - +353 89 605 0161: I mean it's the same style of response
09/09/2025, 17:43 - +44 7958 612614: yes, the society reconstructs it incessantly - mechanism
09/09/2025, 17:44 - +353 89 605 0161: Without reevaluating it?

Just carried forward without examination?
09/09/2025, 17:46 - +44 7958 612614: it's not conscious
09/09/2025, 17:47 - +44 7958 612614: it gets modified in social fields
09/09/2025, 17:47 - onur: I told u it has been established by abrahamic religions
09/09/2025, 17:48 - onur: Or maybe some other religions as well

It could be to differentiate themselves from the earlier norm paganism
09/09/2025, 17:49 - +44 7958 612614: stop talking nonsense 🤣
09/09/2025, 17:49 - onur: It is a known fact that in greek roman mythologies and in a lot of pagan religions nudity and sexual work in temples were ok
09/09/2025, 17:49 - onur: Also sumerian religion
09/09/2025, 17:50 - onur: It probably symbolises civilisation as well
09/09/2025, 17:50 - onur: Not being naked or not showing explicit nudity
09/09/2025, 17:50 - onur: Though it might be changing these days
09/09/2025, 17:50 - onur: But in the past savages were nude and explicitly having sex
09/09/2025, 17:53 - +353 89 605 0161: Yeah, this is what im interested in.

Also, sexuality as sacreligious seems to have some real sticking power.
Fair enough it being unconsciously inherited.
But it came from somewhere and it seems to be fairly resilient.

Other sacreligious behaviours get dropped and become mainstream quite unconsciously it seems.
09/09/2025, 17:54 - onur: I recommend you history of sexuality from Foucault
09/09/2025, 17:55 - +353 89 605 0161: So do you think it was adopted in opposition? To set these people apart
09/09/2025, 17:55 - onur: Its not that unconscious, there is a deliberate intent of controling sexuality by these religions and governments that they go hand in hand with
09/09/2025, 17:56 - onur: Its like indirect eugenics
09/09/2025, 17:56 - onur: Yeah thats what I think because the rome and sumerian religions had it
09/09/2025, 17:57 - onur: And the abrahamic religions are born opposing to them
09/09/2025, 17:57 - onur: And there is an interesting connection about Sumerian nuns and their sexuality and the mary and the jesus story
09/09/2025, 17:58 - onur: That might be related as well

10/09/2025, 10:33 - onur: 1. From Fertility to Transcendence
	•	Pagan religions (Mesopotamian, Greek, Roman, Egyptian, etc.) often tied sex directly to fertility, agricultural cycles, and divine creativity. Sacred prostitution or fertility rites were symbolic acts linking human reproduction to cosmic renewal.
	•	Abrahamic religions (Judaism, then Christianity and Islam) emphasised a transcendent, personal God who was separate from nature. That weakened the link between sexuality, fertility, and the divine. Worship was no longer about imitating nature’s cycles but about obedience and covenant.

⸻

2. Purity and Boundary Maintenance
	•	Ancient Israelite religion developed in a context of small, vulnerable communities surrounded by larger empires. Strict laws about food, circumcision, and sexual conduct functioned as identity markers that distinguished the community.
	•	Sex—because it deals with blood, fluids, and kinship—was especially potent for boundary-making. Hence the many prohibitions in Leviticus (incest, adultery, mixing seed). Sexual control meant cultural survival.

⸻

3. Asceticism and Distrust of the Flesh
	•	In late antiquity, Greek philosophical traditions (Platonism, Stoicism) influenced Christianity. These traditions often saw the body and its passions as inferior to reason or the soul.
	•	Early Christians, especially after Paul, picked up this ascetic streak: abstinence and celibacy became ways of demonstrating holiness, resisting corruption, and anticipating eternal life.
	•	This shift elevated chastity as spiritual ideal and cast unregulated sexuality as spiritually dangerous.

⸻

4. Control of Women and Inheritance
	•	Patriarchal societies had material reasons to regulate sexuality: to ensure paternity, preserve inheritance lines, and control women’s reproductive capacity.
	•	Abrahamic law codes (e.g. prohibitions on adultery) served to protect male lineage and property rights, often framing female sexuality as a site of danger.

⸻

5. The Sacralisation of Marriage
	•	As Abrahamic religions spread, sex outside marriage was demonised because marriage itself became the only legitimate container for sexuality.
	•	Procreation within wedlock was sanctified; all other forms of sexual activity were recast as sinful, deviant, or even demonic.

⸻

6. The Fear of Idolatry
	•	For Jews and early Christians, pagan cults with sacred prostitution, orgiastic festivals, and fertility rituals were associated with idolatry.
	•	Renouncing those practices became part of rejecting false gods. That added a polemical layer: sexual rites weren’t just indulgent—they were blasphemous.

⸻

In short

Sex became sacrilegious in Abrahamic traditions not because sex itself was inherently evil, but because:
	•	it threatened group boundaries,
	•	it conflicted with an ascetic, transcendent vision of holiness,
	•	it destabilised patriarchal inheritance systems,
	•	and it was associated with “pagan” rivals

The Abrahamic God's first commandment is

"Be fruitful and multiply"
10/09/2025, 10:36 - +44 7958 612614: I don’t agree with anything that @⁨onur⁩  says.  It;s a healthy reflex
10/09/2025, 10:36 - Will-hazzer777: Paganism had too much reverence for the natural world which gets in the way of procreation.

The Abrahamic God says "Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth and subdue it"

10/09/2025, 10:37 - onur: So sex was so free in order to be fruitful so it had to be organized and turned into a sin to be confessed in a church

The reason why the Islamists are so hot on covering up women, just as the Victorians did is because modesty and control of women and female sexuality creates more children.

10/09/2025, 10:53 - onur: I wrote it so many times I started to write just sex
10/09/2025, 10:54 - onur: But yeah public display of sex is the actual concept we are discussing
10/09/2025, 10:54 - onur: No
10/09/2025, 10:54 - onur: What was common was killing female babies
10/09/2025, 10:54 - +44 7958 612614: cannibalism very common??  Really?
10/09/2025, 10:54 - Will-hazzer777: "Cover the face and fire the base"
10/09/2025, 10:54 - +44 7516 029853: I have no plans on becoming a queen.
But it helps me spot my allies before I have even got a plan. Admirers tend to prefer those who can make enemies. Martin, I’m sorry, but you don’t have the faintest idea about life. 🙃 <This message was edited>
10/09/2025, 10:54 - onur: But this wasnt for sacrifice
10/09/2025, 10:55 - +44 7516 029853: Still quite is
10/09/2025, 10:55 - Will-hazzer777: Ritualistic cannibalism was more common amongst pagans. Abrahamics would typically only engage in it during famine.
10/09/2025, 10:55 - +44 7958 612614: lol, “I have no plans on becoming a queen” - i’m so suspicious of vehement denials
10/09/2025, 10:55 - onur: It was a lot more common in the past throughout the old world from asia to africa, not sure about europe that much
10/09/2025, 10:56 - onur: I am 5’10 and a middle manager
10/09/2025, 10:56 - onur: Btw hahah
10/09/2025, 10:56 - Will-hazzer777: The lady doth protest too much!
10/09/2025, 10:57 - +44 7958 612614: you said - it was “very common in the ancient world” - now it’s “more common among pagans” - shifting sands
10/09/2025, 10:57 - onur: No bro
10/09/2025, 10:57 - onur: Thats just wrong
10/09/2025, 10:57 - +44 7958 612614: are you really 5’10?  I always view you as a 5’5
10/09/2025, 10:57 - onur: Im 178 yea
10/09/2025, 10:57 - +44 7958 612614: I thought I was taller than you
10/09/2025, 10:58 - +44 7958 612614: but we’re the same
10/09/2025, 10:58 - onur: Well u have a lot of delusions
10/09/2025, 10:58 - Will-hazzer777: It's to do with timelines... It became less common in iron age communities. The further back in time you go the more common it gets.
10/09/2025, 10:58 - +44 7958 612614: looks that way
10/09/2025, 10:58 - onur: I was a good soldier too
10/09/2025, 10:58 - onur: So double confirmed
10/09/2025, 10:59 - onur: No
10/09/2025, 10:59 - +44 7958 612614: what are you on about now?  You said very common, then “it’s to do with timelines”?    How can you be so sure what was going on in iron age communities?
10/09/2025, 11:00 - +44 7958 612614: jesus, what a joke of an army
10/09/2025, 11:00 - +44 7958 612614: how long did you stay in the army?
10/09/2025, 11:00 - onur: 2 months 😂😂😂
10/09/2025, 11:00 - onur: But i was good while it lasted
10/09/2025, 11:00 - onur: Hahaha
10/09/2025, 11:00 - +44 7958 612614: hahaha
10/09/2025, 11:01 - +44 7958 612614: clever people never stay too long in the army, you won some points tehre
10/09/2025, 11:01 - +44 7516 029853: I wonder if there will be a decent tool to calculate the number of people sacrificed in particular countries and at a particular time.
Then to make coherent statistics.
Would the result be that it was always teenage girls who were sacrificed or an unexpected result?
10/09/2025, 11:01 - onur: I wasnt common at all
10/09/2025, 11:01 - +44 7516 029853: Of course, it would be a projection, but still interesting
10/09/2025, 11:02 - Will-hazzer777: Yes!
10/09/2025, 11:03 - onur: 😅
10/09/2025, 11:03 - +44 7516 029853: No
10/09/2025, 11:03 - Will-hazzer777: I know about iron age stuff..
10/09/2025, 11:03 - Will-hazzer777: "Children – both male and female, and mostly a few weeks old – were sacrificed by the Carthaginians at locations known as tophets. The practice was also carried out by their neighbours at other Phoenician colonies in Sicily, Sardinia and Malta. "

10/09/2025, 11:07 - onur: Bro hundreds of billions of people have lived
10/09/2025, 11:07 - onur: I am not saying sacrifice didnt exist
10/09/2025, 11:07 - onur: :D
10/09/2025, 11:07 - onur: Are we even discussing the same thing?
10/09/2025, 11:07 - onur: I also said killing the female babies were also common, maybe it was that lol
10/09/2025, 11:08 - Will-hazzer777: https://www.sapiens.org/biology/cannibalism-ritualized-sacred/
10/09/2025, 11:08 - +44 7958 612614: hotly contested - it’s totally uncertain whether there were sacrifices, especially on a large scale.  It’s often attributed to “enemy propaganda”.
10/09/2025, 11:08 - Will-hazzer777: You're confusing it with the Chinese... Ancient people didn't select on sex as far as I'm aware, they selected based on deformities and the like.
10/09/2025, 11:09 - +44 7958 612614: “may have” - you can say that anything may have happened to promote a stupid research or article.  They know there’ll be someone like you to get excited about it
10/09/2025, 11:09 - Will-hazzer777: It was pretty common.
10/09/2025, 11:09 - onur: Many of the skulls appear to have been used as drinking vessels, indicating that the devouring of the human dead served a ritual purpose for the people who visited this cave. This was not mere cannibalism-for-survival; it was cannibalism-as-a-sacred-practice.
10/09/2025, 11:09 - onur: Is this cannibalism?
10/09/2025, 11:09 - onur: What a joke
10/09/2025, 11:09 - onur: :D
10/09/2025, 11:09 - onur: Cannibalism is another effort to differentiate civilization from savages
10/09/2025, 11:09 - onur: Its a narrative
10/09/2025, 11:09 - Will-hazzer777: "May have" is based on the interpretation of this particular site... Not about interpretation of the practice as a whole going on.
10/09/2025, 11:10 - onur: even the term is coined after geographical discoveries
10/09/2025, 11:10 - onur: :D
10/09/2025, 11:10 - +44 7958 612614: “pretty common” - another meaningless statistical measurement
10/09/2025, 11:10 - Will-hazzer777: It is in their own sacred texts.
10/09/2025, 11:10 - onur: Whom?
10/09/2025, 11:10 - onur: Whose?
10/09/2025, 11:10 - onur: :D
10/09/2025, 11:11 - +44 7958 612614: imagine taking 2 opposing accounts about anything hotly contested today.  If someone in future received only 1 that would be the fact
10/09/2025, 11:11 - +44 7958 612614: whatever got through is considered to be the truth
10/09/2025, 11:13 - Will-hazzer777: "First-century historian Pliny the Elder went further, suggesting the Celts practiced ritual cannibalism, eating their enemies' flesh as a source of spiritual and physical strength."

10/09/2025, 11:16 - +44 7958 612614: Anyway, this is really all about poor “abstract thinking” - when someone is able to understand concrete facts but fails to draw inferences or apply a principle to new context.  That’s what we see in the media and served by politicians - yesterday our government says they can’t say whether any violations of human rights have been going on in middle east, but this morning they are all very adamant that russians deliberately sent drones into Poland - only a few hours after the event.  People seem to struggle with detecting inconsistencies.  Just like we can’t catch people in central London stealing mobiles on electric bikes, but can miraculously hit terrorists with drones half the way across the globe.
10/09/2025, 11:17 - +44 7958 612614: @⁨Will-hazzer777⁩  - I can coach you in abstract thinking and I'm cheap!  Results guaranteed.
10/09/2025, 11:17 - +44 7516 029853: I honestly was joking and saying no just to disagree 🥲.

I am lost in the thread anyway
10/09/2025, 11:17 - +44 7958 612614: Also, for all of you stuggling to find gfriends/boyfriends - I’ll put togheter  and cheap course 🤑💸💰
10/09/2025, 11:20 - Will-hazzer777: "But not all kinds of cannibalism were condemned in medieval Icelandic literature. Certain human saga characters seem to have known ancient magical properties of human (and animal) organs, and to have believed in “sympathetic magic”. This form of magic was widespread in ancient times, and was based on the principle that “like attracts like”: according to it, for instance, eating specific parts of the human body (or drinking its blood) would transfer the qualities of the eaten – his strength, bravery, etc. – to the eater. In this case, cannibalism would make the eater a stronger human, a man with supernatural abilities."

10/09/2025, 11:22 - +44 7958 612614: Storms - bad luck or God’s punishment?  These are just “stories” that you get excited about. Dan Brown is probably your favourite author
10/09/2025, 11:22 - +44 7958 612614: popular science
10/09/2025, 11:22 - Will-hazzer777: They're not inconsistencies ... You're looking at it wrong because as @⁨~Cristina I.⁩ rightly points out "you don't have the faintest idea about life".
10/09/2025, 11:23 - Will-hazzer777: Nobody really believes in human rights... That's why they can't be detected.
10/09/2025, 11:23 - +44 7958 612614: ad hominem 🙁
10/09/2025, 11:23 - Will-hazzer777: "Human rights" is just a buzz term for "I don't like you".
10/09/2025, 11:25 - Will-hazzer777: So the term is only rolled out and often misapplied because nobody really believes in them.
10/09/2025, 11:25 - +44 7958 612614: you’re again missing the point - you only comment to promote your far right ideology.  My point is about inconsistency that people fail to notice and you’ve missed the point because you can’t apply the principle to new context.  You only recognised “/human rights2/ and had a knee jerk reaction
10/09/2025, 11:25 - +44 7958 612614: that’s exactly what I’m talking about
10/09/2025, 11:26 - Will-hazzer777: Human rights don't have to be believed in nor recognised... It's just a buzz term mate.
10/09/2025, 11:26 - +44 7958 612614: It was nothing about human rights - it’s about how people cannot connect that it makes no sense that something very obvious cannot be analysed over large period of time and something where there’s no information can be asserted after a very short period of time
10/09/2025, 11:26 - Will-hazzer777: It's not about the information... Nobody cares about the analysis.
10/09/2025, 11:26 - Will-hazzer777: That's not how its used. <This message was edited>
10/09/2025, 11:27 - Will-hazzer777: It's like weapons of mass destruction...
10/09/2025, 11:27 - +44 7958 612614: you’re talking nonsense again - human rights are enshrined in Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR, 1948) and various national consitutions and laws
10/09/2025, 11:28 - +44 7958 612614: just because you have an opinion makes no difference.
10/09/2025, 11:29 - Will-hazzer777: It's all bollocks... Nobody believes in them... Even the people who came up with them hated eachother's guts. They're just a political football to apply or misapply at will...
10/09/2025, 11:29 - +44 7958 612614: just like any traffic or criminal laws are void before metaphysics - they are very real in teh context of a society which has power to enforce them
10/09/2025, 11:29 - Will-hazzer777: You can't get driving points on a licence you don't have.
10/09/2025, 11:29 - +44 7958 612614: who cares whether anyone believes in them - there are domestic laws that are guided by them
10/09/2025, 11:30 - +44 7958 612614: what’s that to do with anything??
10/09/2025, 11:31 - Will-hazzer777: They're not domestic laws... They're just a brand stamp... They're used for or against all and sundry regardless of what the law actually says. They're just a brandishing rod.

10/09/2025, 11:32 - Will-hazzer777: Laws are just meaningless words... Nobody really reads them or applies them. They just do whatever they feel like and say that's what the law says or not. <This message was edited>
10/09/2025, 11:33 - +44 7958 612614: The Human Rights Act 1998 (HRA) incorporates most ECHR rights into UK domestic law.  So we must follow them.  Taht’s why certain peoplle want us out of ECHR.  You’re wrong again, again, again
10/09/2025, 11:34 - +44 7958 612614: nobody applies laws?  You’re deluded. Why are you paying taxes, rent, pay for food, not drive without license, not travel without passport?  if you think that laws are meaningless and un-enforcable
10/09/2025, 11:35 - +44 7958 612614: i wonder if you’re just a demagogue or you really fail to understand things? <This message was edited>
10/09/2025, 11:36 - Will-hazzer777: Look nobody has to follow anything and they can interpret them how they like... Like Poland and Hungary do... You just need  the authority to interpret or misinterpret anything the way you want to.
10/09/2025, 11:38 - +44 7958 612614: you “just” need the authority - that’s not reality.  “Nobody is poor, you just need money to lift you out of poverty”.  Nobody is stupid - you just need intelligence…. Honestly, you’re artful at writing stuff which has no meaning
10/09/2025, 11:39 - +44 7958 612614: yep, I’m sure that’s poor abstract thinking.
10/09/2025, 11:40 - +44 7958 612614: that’s probably what trips your throughout your life
10/09/2025, 11:40 - +44 7958 612614: it’s like trying to run with feet bound together
10/09/2025, 11:40 - Will-hazzer777: I follow rules that I can't get away with not following. However often a lot of those rules aren't rules as laid down in law in writing, nor does the letter of the law get applied...

It's just made up as people go along... And it's easier just to along with certain things because they happen automatically... Like paying PAYE or VAT.

Things aren't as rigid as you would like them to be.
10/09/2025, 11:40 - +44 7958 612614: more like stumbling 🙁
10/09/2025, 11:41 - Will-hazzer777: Those are the people who take the letter of the law too seriously... Instead of purely listening to the interpretation of the person with the biggest stick.
10/09/2025, 11:41 - +44 7958 612614: you said “laws are just meaningless words” - now you’re saying “some laws are just meaningless words” - you need some reflexivity to understand how jumbled your thoughts come acrosss
10/09/2025, 11:42 - +44 7958 612614: <Media omitted>
10/09/2025, 11:43 - Will-hazzer777: It depends on the situation... It depends if it's applied or not... Or it's just applied to you because the authorities want to get you on something... But generally don't apply the law at all.
10/09/2025, 11:43 - +44 7958 612614: now it also depends on the situation!  Holy mackerel!!
10/09/2025, 11:43 - Will-hazzer777: E.g. prosecuting families who mutilate their female children's genitals.. it isn't applied...
10/09/2025, 11:44 - Will-hazzer777: Or making sure that Christian prayers are said in schools at the beginning of each day.
10/09/2025, 11:45 - +44 7958 612614: This is what Bannon talks about when he says “Flood the zone with shit”
10/09/2025, 11:45 - Will-hazzer777: There are loads of laws that aren't applied... Loads that are misapplied and most are based on interpretation... Often lots of laws are here one minute gone tomorrow...
10/09/2025, 11:46 - +44 7958 612614: and different dinosaurs…
10/09/2025, 11:46 - +44 7958 612614: OK, I need to go now, lovely chatting - I’ve learned a lot today. 🙏
10/09/2025, 11:46 - Will-hazzer777: Often nobody tells the general public about changes, and most of the time, people just go about their business as usual.
10/09/2025, 11:47 - Will-hazzer777: Loads of laws are just plainly unenforceable.
10/09/2025, 11:49 - Will-hazzer777: Sometimes they're only used when you're an enemy of the people in authority; and even they find it difficult to get their enforcement agents to apply it or even apply it correctly.
10/09/2025, 11:50 - Will-hazzer777: And unfortunately laws don't stop things from happening... Only procedures do that.
10/09/2025, 11:54 - Will-hazzer777: And as we know most things people think of as crime goes unpunished, either because of lack of evidence, poor / no investigation, legal loop holes, laxed attitude and local policing policies, 'social justice' considerations, community sentiments, or just no laws against x, y or z.
10/09/2025, 11:57 - Will-hazzer777: Also blind eyes and political partiality ... Which is what law and law enforcement really is about....

10/09/2025, 17:22 - onur: 😁😅
10/09/2025, 17:25 - +44 7516 029853: @⁨onur⁩ do you have a strong Turkish accent? how does it sound in general?
10/09/2025, 17:26 - +44 7516 029853: I am not sure I have spoken to many of your compatriots
10/09/2025, 18:04 - onur: Yeah i have it
10/09/2025, 18:04 - onur: I mean I am trying to pronounce correctly but if I am speaking quickly it slips
10/09/2025, 18:04 - onur: :D
10/09/2025, 18:06 - onur: I mean the sound is varied according to the level of english
10/09/2025, 18:07 - onur: If they have good english it would be understandable with a turkish flavour
10/09/2025, 18:07 - onur: I guess
10/09/2025, 18:07 - onur: XD
10/09/2025, 18:07 - onur: There are times I have not been understood by british people but they were mostly lowly educated people who only knows 1 language
10/09/2025, 18:08 - onur: At work its fine
10/09/2025, 18:09 - onur: But id say its not as heavy as chinese or indian or spanish
10/09/2025, 18:35 - +44 7516 029853: I love achieving a state when I am absolutely exhausted and/or drunk like a pigsy, so I can't speak any language at all. It immediately gives an understanding of whether that is a true friendship needing no words or something shallow (intellectual) 🙃

It worked for them with Iran so fuck it, and they're murdering an entire civilian population without so much as a slap on the wrist from their backers so if I was Israel, and wanted the same ends they do, I'd be going crazy like this rn

10/09/2025, 21:41 - Parag-meetup: Damn , I hope it’s not fatal
10/09/2025, 21:42 - +44 7446 051842: I hope he’s not martyred. 
Also I’m not very happy with the shooter.

Now I am sorry ever so slightly

10/09/2025, 22:02 - Parag-meetup: Or if you could ?
10/09/2025, 22:03 - +44 7516 029853: Why exactly?
10/09/2025, 22:21 - Parag-meetup: Personal dislike
10/09/2025, 22:21 - Parag-meetup: Also seems like a tribute

11/09/2025, 03:10 - +353 89 605 0161: Well if he is matyred... He was pretty mid, didn't deserve to die . <This message was edited>
11/09/2025, 08:21 - Parag-meetup: I followed him , like I follow @⁨Will-hazzer777⁩ and a lot other people on the other side of the political spectrum , to keep me informed and challenge my beliefs

11/09/2025, 11:08 - Will-hazzer777: Am I going to get shot?
11/09/2025, 11:25 - Parag-meetup: If you go an live in Romania or usa
11/09/2025, 11:29 - +44 7516 029853: How many public speakers/journalists were shot in Romania? Definitely much less than in India, if taking on average, especially after 1989.
11/09/2025, 11:33 - +44 7516 029853: To add, Romania, unfortunately, is increasingly supporting more and more far-right parties.
AUR ~golden shower~, Alliance for the Union of Romanians, had its best results last year, becoming the second most popular party. <This message was edited>
11/09/2025, 11:34 - onur: That was so unlucky
11/09/2025, 11:34 - onur: I watched the video
11/09/2025, 11:34 - onur: Imagine dying like that
11/09/2025, 11:34 - onur: Bullet bouncing off from your kevlar :D
11/09/2025, 11:35 - onur: What a way to go
11/09/2025, 11:35 - onur: I didnt know him though, why all hate?
11/09/2025, 11:39 - +44 7516 029853: The guy was wanking on the Second Amendment, mentioned multiple times that he stands by it, even if it means people will die disproportionately (“a few deaths” are worth it to keep our gun laws). I think he reaped what he sowed.
11/09/2025, 11:40 - +44 7516 029853: He was actively promoting ultra-conservative values, being openly misogynistic and blaming Ukraine for being the victim.
He wasn't even occasionally nuanced as Bed Shapiro, just representing blank bigotry.
11/09/2025, 11:49 - Parag-meetup: I said Romania because that’s where he wants to go and settle
11/09/2025, 11:50 - Parag-meetup: That’s half of America right now and tbh half of uk and Europe also
11/09/2025, 11:50 - +44 7958 612614: thousands of people die every day even more miserably - why is this any worse?
11/09/2025, 11:51 - +44 7958 612614: Princess Di effect?  W/herever media shines light - zombies go beserk
11/09/2025, 11:54 - +44 7516 029853: Yes, but in Romania @⁨Will-hazzer777⁩ will be safe, unlike the US
11/09/2025, 12:43 - Will-hazzer777: Don't provoke a neighbour you know you're going to lose to... That's just naive and foolish.
11/09/2025, 12:44 - Will-hazzer777: Yeah it's not safe for conservatives in the US...
11/09/2025, 12:46 - Will-hazzer777: There are inadvertent deaths and what some might see as due to direct and deliberate human agency. That's the difference. If like you were to die of a heart attack or die from being shot in the head. It's of a different moral quality. <This message was edited>
11/09/2025, 12:54 - +44 7516 029853: "Don't wear 'revealing clothes' and you will never be raped" - logic detected.
Deeply despise this way of thinking.
11/09/2025, 13:04 - Will-hazzer777: It is analogous though...

If you happen to increasingly live in a country where you're surrounded by men of diverse origin who can't control themselves when they see women and girls who are not covered from temple to toe... Then girls better beware of what they support and wear.

In the same way, when you know that you have a neighbour who is a bully and much bigger and stronger than you are... It's better to keep a low profile... Otherwise well... There are consequences...

Regardless of the moral or ideological rights and wherefores... Whoever has the biggest stick rules the roost... That's always been true... People have been deluded and duped since 1945 that that hasn't been the rule....as far as forever. The western winners of WWII taught their children and grandchildren to believe their contrary bullshit. <This message was edited>
11/09/2025, 13:07 - Will-hazzer777: Whether you despise something or not isn't the issue... It's like despising the fact that the tooth fairy doesn't exist.

11/09/2025, 13:21 - Will-hazzer777: I however think people make a category error in thinking that killings due to human action aren't inadvertent... They are inadvertent. <This message was edited>
11/09/2025, 13:24 - Will-hazzer777: All actions are inadvertent because either they are due to random fluctuations or because they are determined due to various causal and chaotic factors.
11/09/2025, 13:25 - Will-hazzer777: Free will might be an illusion but we are determined to live as though it does.
11/09/2025, 13:32 - +44 7958 612614: meaningless - you could go on forever inventing tautological “explanations”

they are chance events
beyond conscious control
defined by complex causal chains
“inevitably” non intentional
interplay between randomness and fickleness…
11/09/2025, 13:33 - +44 7958 612614: might be an illusion or might not be an illusion (very wise)
11/09/2025, 13:34 - Will-hazzer777: All I'm trying to say is that as far as we can tell...free will doesn't exist...

As I mentioned either things are random or determined... Neither gives space for free will.
11/09/2025, 13:34 - +44 7958 612614: caveats…. As far as I can tell from my experience pygmies don’t exist
11/09/2025, 13:34 - Will-hazzer777: Well I'm not ruling it out... Just ruling it out for now.
11/09/2025, 13:34 - +44 7958 612614: not to mention atoms, nobody can even imagine them

11/09/2025, 13:42 - +44 7958 612614: but ultimately based on data points
11/09/2025, 13:44 - Will-hazzer777: It would be interesting to see which contributors an AI system would rank from highest to lowest likelihood of being an NPC.
11/09/2025, 13:50 - Will-hazzer777: Chatgpt thinks that the US's most recent presidents are the most NPC like. I.e. very party-line scripted.

12/09/2025, 14:03 - +44 7958 612614: lol, it's feminist encoded - you can't understand it, not cool enough

12/09/2025, 16:05 - Will-hazzer777: I don't really understand what you're saying and don't think id find it that interesting if you did explain it... so I said "whatever".
12/09/2025, 17:06 - +44 7958 612614: i was just trolling you - i wasn’t saying anything
12/09/2025, 17:06 - +44 7958 612614: as usual...
12/09/2025, 17:07 - +44 7958 612614: but that’s a bit unfair on me
12/09/2025, 17:08 - +44 7958 612614: I actually read somewhere recently that “new” men will be able to read feminist encoded messages and fall into line in this new female dominated world
12/09/2025, 17:09 - +44 7958 612614: and those who can’t will be left out on account of being unable to effectively communicate
12/09/2025, 17:09 - +44 7958 612614: so i liked the expression - able to decode feminist encoded messages
12/09/2025, 17:12 - Will-hazzer777: Didn't understand that either

13/09/2025, 21:54 - +44 7516 029853: A few very important facts I learned today: 
* Kids have potty training books
* They start laughing at 3-4 months and joking at 2-3 (more sophisticated jokes come at the age of 3-4)

(I started a hypothetical experiment, to decide when it would be potentially acceptable to unalive babies based on the level of their developed consciousness)

* No hypothetical babies ended up being hurt
13/09/2025, 22:37 - +44 7958 612614: I found out today that high alcohol content beers taste really smooth.  Maybe you can incorporate it into your hypothesis?
13/09/2025, 22:47 - Will-hazzer777: When would it be acceptable? <This message was edited>
13/09/2025, 22:48 - +44 7516 029853: Imperial Stout?
13/09/2025, 22:51 - +44 7516 029853: We were stuck discussing it for at least an hour, trying to find the perfect moment in those babies' lives. 

I lean towards thinking that it's alright as long as the baby is still in its mother's body, not born yet.
13/09/2025, 22:53 - Will-hazzer777: Isn't birth a bit of an arbitrary cut off point? <This message was edited>
13/09/2025, 22:54 - +44 7958 612614: no, Belgian

13/09/2025, 22:55 - +44 7516 029853: I thought you were as cool as I am when it comes to alcohol consumption.....
13/09/2025, 22:56 - +44 7958 612614: never tried your one - but currently into Duvel, but drank this Leffe Rituel today
13/09/2025, 22:56 - +44 7958 612614: I can never be as cool 🙁
13/09/2025, 22:56 - +44 7516 029853: Leffe is alright.
Still never reaching imperial stout, though
13/09/2025, 22:57 - +44 7958 612614: now i’m curious
13/09/2025, 22:57 - +44 7516 029853: It's like drinking a very alcoholic bread, liquefied and distilled
13/09/2025, 22:57 - +44 7516 029853: The best we could find
13/09/2025, 22:58 - +44 7958 612614: Oh, it’s called Russian Imperial Stout?
13/09/2025, 22:58 - +44 7958 612614: <Media omitted>
13/09/2025, 22:58 - +44 7958 612614: ?
13/09/2025, 22:58 - +44 7958 612614: jeez 10.4%
13/09/2025, 22:58 - +44 7958 612614: lol
13/09/2025, 23:00 - +44 7516 029853: Never had a russian imperial stout, but the one I like is quite niche, tends to be sold in breweries by boys with moustaches 🥸
13/09/2025, 23:00 - +44 7516 029853: and the proper imperial stout has 13.5+%
13/09/2025, 23:01 - +44 7958 612614: wow!!!
13/09/2025, 23:02 - +44 7958 612614: can’t wait to try
13/09/2025, 23:02 - +44 7516 029853: and because I am a girl, I prefer chocolate, coffee or coconut imperial stout
13/09/2025, 23:03 - +44 7516 029853: they tend to add an interesting profile and complexity to the taste 

just imperial stout isn't that good
13/09/2025, 23:03 - +44 7958 612614: oh, you’re a girl!!!  🎉
13/09/2025, 23:04 - +44 7958 612614: I’ll try flavoured beer (because I’m an open minded person)
13/09/2025, 23:07 - Will-hazzer777: Why is it 'the best'?
13/09/2025, 23:09 - +44 7516 029853: It was a bit of a final-draft situation in a complex problem

15/09/2025, 18:24 - +44 7516 029853: Do you send daily voice messages? I have an impression that it's for under 30s, once 30 is hit, people stop using them (then start using again approaching baby boomer age)
15/09/2025, 18:26 - Will-hazzer777: I have friends who are in their 30s who use voice notes.
15/09/2025, 18:28 - +44 7516 029853: "voice notes" sounds like banknotes but an audible currency 🙃
15/09/2025, 18:53 - +353 89 605 0161: It's a power move sending a voice note.
I won't listen to them and I won't negotiate with those who send them.

15/09/2025, 19:18 - +44 7958 612614: lol, I read it “licking” first time
15/09/2025, 19:18 - Ali: So did I… now my screens really wet
15/09/2025, 19:18 - +44 7958 612614: pictures to prove
15/09/2025, 19:19 - +44 7958 612614: no, I actually read it stop “licking my pecks”
15/09/2025, 19:20 - +353 89 605 0161: I would never say that
15/09/2025, 19:20 - +44 7958 612614: which makes sense under the circumstances
15/09/2025, 19:20 - +44 7958 612614: stop being contrarian
15/09/2025, 19:21 - +44 7958 612614: yes, but because @⁨Ali⁩  was involved - I imagined what she could have said
15/09/2025, 19:23 - +44 7516 029853: A solid try, Alison. But I am straight 😭
15/09/2025, 19:25 - Ali: What are you implying ?
15/09/2025, 19:26 - Ali: Same grrrlllll 💅🏻
15/09/2025, 19:26 - +44 7516 029853: I call it being seriously cursed
15/09/2025, 19:28 - +44 7958 612614: I’m not implying - I’m expliciting
15/09/2025, 19:28 - +44 7958 612614: it’s shadow work - bringing stuff from the unconscoius
15/09/2025, 19:28 - +44 7516 029853: "I think, therefore I am" vibe
15/09/2025, 19:29 - +44 7958 612614: it’s a hard job - someone’s got to do it
15/09/2025, 19:30 - +44 7958 612614: what - being straight?
15/09/2025, 19:31 - +44 7958 612614: oh, what’s fascinating is … 😉
15/09/2025, 19:31 - +44 7958 612614: when you compare men to women (visually and in depth)
15/09/2025, 19:32 - +44 7958 612614: you realise there’s so little different, in face, for example
15/09/2025, 19:32 - +44 7516 029853: Yes.
I genuinely tried converting myself into bisexuality, but it just doesn't work despite serious attempts. 

That's why I fully support gays/bisexuals
15/09/2025, 19:32 - +44 7958 612614: it’s just that we’re really finely discerning at seeing these small things that make all the difference
15/09/2025, 19:32 - +44 7516 029853: What? Not at all
15/09/2025, 19:32 - +44 7958 612614: well, I support everyone, doh
15/09/2025, 19:33 - +44 7516 029853: Everything is very different. Skin, smell especially
15/09/2025, 19:33 - +44 7958 612614: hmmm, when I’m looking at photos, usually there’s. only the smell of the paper
15/09/2025, 19:33 - +44 7958 612614: or my monitor - which smells the same regardless of what’s on it
15/09/2025, 19:34 - +44 7958 612614: i was thinking about physionomy and how a lot of it comes from longish hair
15/09/2025, 19:35 - +44 7958 612614: and if women shaved their heads - you’d find it very puzzling, even though there are head shape peculiarities, but they are small, unless to a discerning eye
15/09/2025, 19:35 - +44 7958 612614: and we all have that discerning eye
15/09/2025, 19:35 - +44 7958 612614: just like we can’t see any differences between male and female dogs or cats in their faces
15/09/2025, 19:36 - +44 7958 612614: but there are probably some distinctinons - visual and mannerism in particular
15/09/2025, 19:36 - +44 7958 612614: how hard did you try? 🤣🤣. What tripped you?

15/09/2025, 19:38 - +44 7958 612614: “better than chance”
15/09/2025, 19:38 - +44 7958 612614: but anyway - I can’t - yet I can tell a man from a woman 😉
15/09/2025, 19:38 - +44 7958 612614: nothing like being destroyed by a woman 💥💣
15/09/2025, 19:38 - +44 7516 029853: It's just incurable

15/09/2025, 19:40 - +44 7958 612614: oh, it’s gotten dark outside - like the weather’s gonna kick off
15/09/2025, 19:40 - +44 7958 612614: and it’s bloody windy

15/09/2025, 20:00 - +44 7958 612614: which bit?
15/09/2025, 20:00 - Ali: Everything
15/09/2025, 20:01 - Ali: The weather mainly
15/09/2025, 20:02 - +44 7958 612614: but it makes it cozy to be at home - pour some drink, put the music on and read a book
15/09/2025, 20:02 - Ali: I might open a bottle of red actually. Thanks for giving me permission x
15/09/2025, 20:05 - +44 7958 612614: Permission granted.  Over and out.
15/09/2025, 20:17 - +353 89 605 0161: Martin can I open a bottle of red too?
15/09/2025, 20:19 - +44 7958 612614: Be my guest - room temperature or slightly chilled?
15/09/2025, 20:20 - +353 89 605 0161: Well I've not got the heating on in the kitchen so both I guess 🤔
15/09/2025, 20:26 - Ali: @⁨~Martin⁩ how much wine should I pour in my glass?
15/09/2025, 20:33 - +44 7958 612614: How big is your glass?

15/09/2025, 20:56 - +44 7958 612614: of course, just make sure you keep me updated of your next steps
15/09/2025, 20:57 - Ali: Ok, thank you 🙏🏻 I’ve just taken a sip and put the glass back down on the mat, on the table. Hope that’s alright 😬

15/09/2025, 21:00 - Ali: Not really. I was a little bit anxious tbh

16/09/2025, 12:45 - onur: If I need to consult on a serious important decision

16/09/2025, 12:48 - Parag-meetup: That’s why you are in a sticky patch
16/09/2025, 12:48 - onur: Not all men are wise and logical but if someone is wise and logical i would say there is a bigger chance that person is a male
16/09/2025, 12:48 - onur: Everybody knows I am right
16/09/2025, 12:48 - +44 7958 612614: I don’t know why I like you - you’re such a dipstick 🤣
16/09/2025, 12:48 - onur: Just admit it
16/09/2025, 12:48 - onur: They call me personable
16/09/2025, 12:49 - onur: I dont understand why either
16/09/2025, 12:49 - +44 7958 612614: maybe because i see you as someone who’s so fragile that I feel protective
16/09/2025, 12:49 - +44 7958 612614: and I definitely do see you as a fragile person
16/09/2025, 12:50 - +44 7958 612614: anyway, if you get that job - you owe me a drink. -coming to the social?
16/09/2025, 12:50 - onur: https://open.spotify.com/track/7EExKNitXoRvmPwZy0hbPO?si=eohotThVSjeMJAtFNBiWIw
16/09/2025, 12:50 - onur: Yeah I will buy you 2 drinks so you owe me one for the next one
16/09/2025, 12:52 - onur: I am an open book, especially among friends. Everybody has their sweet spots and has moments where they show strength
16/09/2025, 12:52 - onur: I am not afraid to show vulnerability thinking it might be used against me later on
16/09/2025, 12:53 - +44 7958 612614: fair enough
16/09/2025, 12:53 - +44 7958 612614: showing vulnerability is the best way to get affection
16/09/2025, 12:53 - +44 7958 612614: but it’s not easy to utilise if it doesnt’ come naturally to you
16/09/2025, 12:53 - onur: Nothing comes naturally to me
16/09/2025, 12:54 - onur: 🤣
16/09/2025, 12:54 - onur: There are 2 wolves in me…

16/09/2025, 12:56 - onur: Tie a stick to it
16/09/2025, 12:56 - onur: Low stress training
16/09/2025, 12:56 - onur: And there is not enough space for that
16/09/2025, 12:57 - onur: You need to give it more space
16/09/2025, 12:57 - +44 7958 612614: for 2 gay wolves?
16/09/2025, 12:57 - onur: There is always a spot inside me for 2 gay wolves <This message was edited>
16/09/2025, 12:58 - +44 7958 612614: you’re not gay - you’re FABULOUS

16/09/2025, 12:59 - Parag-meetup: Yes
16/09/2025, 13:00 - +44 7958 612614: are you coming to London specifically for this?
16/09/2025, 13:00 - Parag-meetup: Join me at London Philosophy Cafe https://meetu.ps/e/Pxhmt/xRnvc/i
16/09/2025, 13:00 - Parag-meetup: And other things
16/09/2025, 13:00 - Parag-meetup: There is the philosophy festival this weekend
16/09/2025, 13:01 - Parag-meetup: How the light gets in
16/09/2025, 13:01 - +44 7958 612614: oh, yes…
16/09/2025, 13:01 - +44 7958 612614: well, looking forward to seeing you
16/09/2025, 13:02 - onur: Ok i will also come
16/09/2025, 13:02 - onur: See you guys there

16/09/2025, 13:13 - onur: Armenian genocide mentioned 🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷
16/09/2025, 13:33 - Ali: It depends on what the topic is. This is a generalisation as everyone’s different… however.. Women bring empathy and emotion to the table - which can be helpful in some situations. Where as men tend to look more rationally at the topic. Depending on what you need at the time - you’ll decide who you’d rather choose as a sounding board. Obviously you can find some men who lean more emotionally and some women who are more rational within the realms of problem solving.

Some can also be both! <This message was edited>
16/09/2025, 13:35 - Ali: In the anal cavity?
16/09/2025, 13:40 - onur: that's where the g spot is
16/09/2025, 13:40 - onur: u can ask me if you are not unsure
16/09/2025, 13:40 - onur: whisper in my ear "are u gay?" <This message was edited>
16/09/2025, 14:16 - +44 7958 612614: for me it’s more the unexpected and insightful perspective that I get from women - men seem to be very predictable (to a man’s mind), so no value in confirming what I already know.
16/09/2025, 14:17 - +44 7958 612614: that’s what I’m talking about - so predictable…
16/09/2025, 14:24 - onur: I feel vice versa
16/09/2025, 14:24 - onur: I get confirmed by women more
16/09/2025, 14:24 - onur: If I wanted to feel confirmed/  validated I'd go talk to a woman
16/09/2025, 14:24 - onur: :D
16/09/2025, 14:25 - Ali: You’re so special @⁨onur⁩ your feelings are validated no matter what. We love and care for you. It’s going to be ok. It’s all going to be ok.
16/09/2025, 14:31 - +44 7516 029853: I think that most men are validated too much and do not evaluate their actions enough, while simultaneously being emotionally repressed. 
And a huge reason is the way women tend to unreasonably validate men.
16/09/2025, 14:34 - +44 7516 029853: I can't even tell how many times I have observed that men were conditioned to think that boundaries are just a manipulative tactic. It certainly comes from enabling on the predominantly women's side, yet I have to deal with that 😠
16/09/2025, 14:34 - onur: Like above
16/09/2025, 14:35 - onur: E.g. :D
16/09/2025, 14:35 - onur: The question is
16/09/2025, 14:35 - onur: Does anybody deserve anything?
16/09/2025, 14:36 - +44 7516 029853: Yes, but not entitled
16/09/2025, 14:36 - onur: Whats the difference?
16/09/2025, 14:37 - +44 7516 029853: Deserving is connected to achieving after putting in some effort.
Entitlement comes from an ungrounded feeling that you must get by default.
16/09/2025, 14:38 - +44 7958 612614: <Media omitted>
16/09/2025, 14:39 - +44 7958 612614: you mean - you deserve the reciprocation of what you put in?  Recognition or valorisation?
16/09/2025, 14:39 - +44 7516 029853: I said "connected", not granted
16/09/2025, 14:41 - +44 7516 029853: But putting effort does increase the chances of reciprocation. Yet not guaranteed. 
Thinking that it must be reciprocated is an example of entitlement <This message was edited>
16/09/2025, 14:44 - +44 7516 029853: Another example: "nice guys".
By putting in effort (which they always overestimate), they believe they are entitled to reciprocation from their object of desire
16/09/2025, 14:45 - +44 7958 612614: social capital is defined as expectation that a service rendered will be reciprocated.  It’s not an entitlement - it’s a principle of fairness
16/09/2025, 14:46 - +44 7958 612614: If i say “good morning” - I should expect that you’ll reciprocate
16/09/2025, 14:46 - +44 7516 029853: I am discussing human beings, not capital and systems.
16/09/2025, 14:46 - +44 7958 612614: If i buy a drink one night - i’ll expect that you’ll buy me a drink next time
16/09/2025, 14:46 - +44 7516 029853: expect ≠ entitled
16/09/2025, 14:46 - +44 7958 612614: If you ask for help and I help you - I’d expect you to be forthcoming with your help - that’s the basis of social contracts
16/09/2025, 14:47 - onur: So what Im observing is women are perceiving the events more of an entitled way since more prone to confirming - validating or interpreting events towards that <This message was edited>
16/09/2025, 14:47 - +44 7958 612614: expectation is an acceptance of risk, but it unfulfilled expectation should lead to a breakup of social contract
16/09/2025, 14:48 - +44 7958 612614: entitlement means that you expect something on the back of your “worth” rather than the service rendered
16/09/2025, 14:49 - onur: <Media omitted>
16/09/2025, 14:50 - +44 7958 612614: yep, you need to risk in order to gain
16/09/2025, 14:51 - +44 7516 029853: I think I am entitled to fall in love again. I have "worth" but do not want to see my love as a service rendered.
16/09/2025, 14:51 - +44 7516 029853: What are you going to say now, @⁨~Martin⁩ >?
16/09/2025, 14:51 - onur: Sounds like you are in love with yourself 🤣
16/09/2025, 14:51 - +44 7958 612614: no, the entitlement you’re talking about is your internal one - you’re arguing that you should be free to allow yourself to fall in love
16/09/2025, 14:52 - +44 7516 029853: Guilty! 😊
16/09/2025, 14:52 - onur: And u want someone else to confirm this so it becomes true?
16/09/2025, 14:52 - onur: Ok
16/09/2025, 14:52 - onur: Makes sense I guess
16/09/2025, 14:52 - +44 7958 612614: but if you love someone - it doesn’t mean you’ve rendered service - at that point
16/09/2025, 14:52 - +44 7958 612614: it’s your internal state
16/09/2025, 14:52 - +44 7516 029853: No-no, I am saying I do not want someone to love me because of some "services" I can provide. Infatuation is made for that.
16/09/2025, 14:53 - +44 7958 612614: no-no - nobody will love you because of some “services” you can provide
16/09/2025, 14:53 - Will-hazzer777: What do you want them to love you for?
16/09/2025, 14:53 - onur: Depends on the service
16/09/2025, 14:53 - onur: Tbh
16/09/2025, 14:53 - onur: XD
16/09/2025, 14:54 - onur: Act of services are one of the 5 love languages
16/09/2025, 14:54 - onur: Right?
16/09/2025, 14:54 - +44 7958 612614: but I also have a natural mechanism for withdrawing love when love is not reciprocated
16/09/2025, 14:54 - onur: Why everything I say is true
16/09/2025, 14:54 - onur: Idk
16/09/2025, 14:55 - onur: I needed to learn about that about 10 years ago xD
16/09/2025, 14:55 - +44 7516 029853: It is a highly vulnerable question to publicly answer.
So I will not reply fully. But in a more reduced version, I would get back to the idea that love is not unconditional, but it is also not service-based. It is more about deep intimacy and acceptance. <This message was edited>
16/09/2025, 14:55 - +44 7516 029853: That is smart.
16/09/2025, 14:56 - +44 7516 029853: Why waste your soft tokens?
16/09/2025, 14:56 - +44 7516 029853: 🥹
16/09/2025, 14:56 - onur: I used to think like that as well but I have changed my mind over the time
16/09/2025, 14:57 - +44 7516 029853: I separate love and being in love quite well. 
I thought I loved, until I actually met a person I loved
16/09/2025, 14:57 - +44 7958 612614: mind you - i think that suffering un-reciprocated love is maybe therapeutical to some…
16/09/2025, 14:58 - +44 7516 029853: Triggering for others
16/09/2025, 14:58 - onur: it depends on how u handle it
16/09/2025, 14:59 - +44 7516 029853: I honestly do not prefer suffering and do not find pleasure in emotional roller-coasters.
16/09/2025, 14:59 - +44 7516 029853: There is a huge difference between adventure, excitement and emotional turmoil.
16/09/2025, 14:59 - Will-hazzer777: Loving something is based on how that person makes you feel, you just don't want to feel like you are providing a service when you are being loved by the other person. 

You just want to be loved for being yourself around them?
16/09/2025, 15:00 - +44 7516 029853: But I am very much myself around others as well.
16/09/2025, 15:00 - Will-hazzer777: As you should be, but not everyone is going to love you for being yourself.
16/09/2025, 15:00 - +44 7516 029853: But yes, there is an interesting point you mention. I think it is more about full acceptance and feeling that you are loved fully, not for some elements
16/09/2025, 15:01 - Will-hazzer777: Holistic love
16/09/2025, 15:01 - +44 7958 612614: the scope for forming new relationships is huge.  Even if it leads nowhere - the distraction of exploring is enough to push the unhappy desire into the background
16/09/2025, 15:03 - +44 7958 612614: the very idea that there is a “special one” is ludicrous. There are millions potential partners that would have been a better match than the one you end up with
16/09/2025, 15:08 - +44 7958 612614: I’ve got a friend in Italy.  She’s single and keeps on going on that she can’t find people to socialise with or a romantic partner.  The fact is that she portrays herself as being open-minded and available for socialising - but she’s totally opposite of that.  Most of the time she has preconceptions that a potential event, meeting, occasion wouldn’t be what she’s looking for or that an activity is not what she’s used to doing - so she ends up being unhappy but feeling justified in thinking it’s others and not her…. I think this is a common scenario.
16/09/2025, 15:08 - Will-hazzer777: Yes, but the odds are lower when two people have to 1) choose eachother 2) exist in the same place and time 3) the union conforms to the social mores of the culture 4) The relationship is convenient enough. <This message was edited>
16/09/2025, 15:09 - +44 7958 612614: odds?  For you everything is algorithmic and cost/benefit proposition.  Sure, you know what life is about - it’s just TOO HARD
16/09/2025, 15:10 - Will-hazzer777: She's watched too many movies or soap operas which portray unrealistic situations and interactions.
16/09/2025, 15:10 - Will-hazzer777: It's all a matter of chance sometimes.
16/09/2025, 15:11 - +44 7958 612614: no, she’s just too stuck in her own ways, suffers from superiority complex and overrates ultra-rationalism
16/09/2025, 15:11 - +44 7516 029853: I do not believe in soulmates as well
16/09/2025, 15:11 - +44 7516 029853: Find it incredibly deterministic and illogical.
16/09/2025, 15:11 - Will-hazzer777: Ohh she's like that too... Interesting...
16/09/2025, 15:12 - +44 7958 612614: yep, she’s arrogant about her inability to understand what she’s doing wrong
16/09/2025, 15:13 - Will-hazzer777: Soulmates are just the people you end up with... E.g. you're both examples of my soul people...
16/09/2025, 15:13 - Will-hazzer777: It couldn't have been any other way.
16/09/2025, 15:14 - Will-hazzer777: Souls don't have to necessarily be positive.
16/09/2025, 15:14 - +44 7516 029853: Just to confirm, who do you mean by "both" ?
16/09/2025, 15:15 - Will-hazzer777: You and Martin... As we're talking right now... It couldn't have been any other way...
16/09/2025, 15:15 - +44 7958 612614: Oh, daaaarling ❤️
16/09/2025, 15:15 - +44 7516 029853: 💙
16/09/2025, 15:15 - Will-hazzer777: Mwaa mwaa
16/09/2025, 15:17 - Will-hazzer777: You get thrown together with people...

for better or for worse, in sickness and in health, for richer for poorer, till death we depart.
16/09/2025, 15:18 - Will-hazzer777: There's not much choice in the matter... Either you go with the flow or you struggle against it... Either way... It's just the way it was meant to be.
16/09/2025, 15:26 - +44 7516 029853: How does it feel to have 2 Eastern European soulmates? (one real - @⁨~Martin⁩ , one is an imposter - me)
16/09/2025, 15:28 - Will-hazzer777: Hahaha, I also have a Turkish one @⁨onur⁩ ... Anyone I interact with in a meaningful way I'd call a 'soul person' of mine.

It feels like it was meant to be. 😉
16/09/2025, 15:29 - onur: Awww <This message was edited>
16/09/2025, 15:29 - +44 7516 029853: > a Turkish one @⁨onur⁩ 
so sorry ☠️
16/09/2025, 15:29 - +44 7516 029853: .
16/09/2025, 15:30 - +44 7516 029853: but you need some balance, I get it
16/09/2025, 15:30 - onur: Its obv a joke :D
16/09/2025, 15:31 - onur: This is about how I think now
16/09/2025, 15:31 - Will-hazzer777: Like I said, being a soul person doesn't necessarily have to be a positive experience....

It's like Ebenezer Scrooge's encounters with the ghosts of Christmas present, past and future.
16/09/2025, 15:31 - onur: I think its more of a personal experience rather than a shared one
16/09/2025, 15:32 - Will-hazzer777: This is all shared my soul friend...
16/09/2025, 15:42 - onur: Kind of a chicken and egg situation I guess
16/09/2025, 15:42 - onur: But i would say we are alone in our minds
16/09/2025, 15:42 - onur: Even while communicating
16/09/2025, 15:58 - +44 7958 612614: another banal platitude 😳
16/09/2025, 16:03 - Will-hazzer777: Yeah...
16/09/2025, 16:03 - Will-hazzer777: But it couldn't have been otherwise...

16/09/2025, 16:50 - +44 7516 029853: I recently met a man in his 30s-40s, who is a twin. His brother suddenly got married and the other brother was left alone for the first time. Quite dramatic, I would say
16/09/2025, 16:52 - Will-hazzer777: Poor guy, they should have found another pair of twins to marry.
16/09/2025, 16:52 - Will-hazzer777: Not, my metrics, it couldn't have been any other way.
16/09/2025, 16:53 - +44 7958 612614: let’s gather our thoughts and spare a moment for that wretched soul ...

16/09/2025, 21:20 - +44 7516 029853: "Of the women who based their forecast on a feeling or dream, 71% were correct, and all the women who cited a dream were right."
"Women with more than 12 years of education, however, were right 71 percent of the time -- a rate outside the statistical boundaries of chance. In contrast, the group with less education correctly predicted their fetuses' sex only 43 percent of the time, well within the realm of chance."

17/09/2025, 14:13 - +44 7958 612614: in the grand schema of things - it won’t help.  You’ll “close the doors” on the migrants and then you’ll invent a new delineation category and split citizens along the middle.  Things will get really tough before (and if) the Ai starts generating abundance.  God know what would happen should the EU collapse. <This message was edited>

17/09/2025, 14:28 - Will-hazzer777: Definitely not an immigrant....
17/09/2025, 14:29 - Will-hazzer777: I'm hoping AI doesn't deliver abundance... That'd result in a dystopian world.
17/09/2025, 14:29 - +44 7958 612614: yes, but there’s no other way - all people will lose jobs - like 99%
17/09/2025, 14:29 - +44 7958 612614: so someone either kills them
17/09/2025, 14:29 - +44 7958 612614: or they continue living because they are provided for
17/09/2025, 14:30 - +44 7958 612614: either way - it’s dystopian
17/09/2025, 14:30 - Will-hazzer777: "Did you know that the first Matrix was designed to be a perfect human world? Where none suffered, where everyone would be happy. It was a disaster. No one would accept the program. Entire crops were lost. Some believed we lacked the programming language to describe your perfect world. But I believe that, as a species, human beings define their reality through suffering and misery. The perfect world was a dream that your primitive cerebrum kept trying to wake up from. Which is why the Matrix was redesigned to this: the peak of your civilization." - Agent Smith
17/09/2025, 14:31 - +44 7958 612614: all futures (or most futures) have been covered by creative people’s imagination.   That’s partly why we’re heading there - someone put a seed of a future scenario and fired up people to strive towards it
17/09/2025, 14:31 - Will-hazzer777: Someone? Who are these someone's?
17/09/2025, 14:32 - +44 7958 612614: people who have necessary force to do it
17/09/2025, 14:32 - Will-hazzer777: It's the journey not the destination that makes life worth living.
17/09/2025, 14:32 - +44 7958 612614: why would someone like Trump tolerate a city that’s obscuring his view of a sunset.  Why?
17/09/2025, 14:33 - Will-hazzer777: He wouldn't,  but we're not talking about individuals, we're talking about the human race.
17/09/2025, 14:33 - Will-hazzer777: Comfort will kill us
17/09/2025, 14:34 - +44 7958 612614: no, someone will pull the plug and frame at as a type of euthanasia, eugenics - someone that will long term save humanity...
17/09/2025, 14:34 - +44 7958 612614: it’s easy to see, there have been precedents
17/09/2025, 14:38 - Will-hazzer777: The global average iq is currently 88... It's going to be below 83 by 2070 at current rates... The likelihood anyone will outsmart super intelligence if it arrives on the scene in future is minimal. <This message was edited>

17/09/2025, 14:40 - Will-hazzer777: The EU commission has always been working against Europe's interests... Nothing new there.
17/09/2025, 14:41 - +44 7958 612614: don’t be silly - general artificial intelligence pretty much outsmarts everyone - super intelligence will be incomprehensible to us - in terms of how it works
17/09/2025, 14:42 - +44 7958 612614: super intelligence will be eons ahead of human brain
17/09/2025, 14:42 - Will-hazzer777: It'll shepherd us to a gentle extinction where we choose to commit suicide, not because there will be killer robots.
17/09/2025, 14:42 - +44 7958 612614: faster, more energy efficient, scalable, co-operative, focused
17/09/2025, 14:43 - +44 7958 612614: first threat is humans who will be using the Ai to oppress other humans, then when super intelligence comes - it will be the Ai - maybe we don’t survive the intermediate period
17/09/2025, 14:43 - Will-hazzer777: That's what I am saying.... There's no way that in the future where the average intelligence of humanity is below 83 iq points that anyone will be able to pull the plug on super intelligence.
17/09/2025, 14:44 - +44 7958 612614: of course not - because it’s decentralised and can predict all scenarios devised by a limited mind like ours
17/09/2025, 14:44 - Will-hazzer777: AI that oppresses humanity isn't as much of a threat... If anything it might be of benefit.
17/09/2025, 14:45 - Will-hazzer777: Especially if it oppresses everyone equally.
17/09/2025, 14:46 - onur: Democracy is tyranny of minorities
17/09/2025, 14:47 - +44 7958 612614: ithee was a funny bit about dogs in that video - the guy was saying that humans will be the same as dogs in terms of undertanding what’s going on - the dog probably thinks that every day we go out of the house- we go to get him food 🤣.  Also, in terms of threats to their life - they can only think of someone hitting them with something, running them over  or biting them.  They have no other concepts of what can endanger them.  We’ll be like dogs.  We’ll be operating within that limited subsets of what we can imagine might be dangerous scenarious - but we won’t see 99% of them
17/09/2025, 14:47 - +44 7958 612614: you joining the Banal Platitudes club?  Can you afford the subs?
17/09/2025, 14:47 - onur: Im just sayin

17/09/2025, 14:49 - +44 7958 612614: but why are we talking about the Ai?  It’s so silly - we’ll probably manage to have good lives, so it’s our kids who are screwed 🙁
17/09/2025, 14:49 - onur: <Media omitted>
17/09/2025, 14:50 - Will-hazzer777: We'll not have good lives and our kids and grandchildren if they'll exist will be even more screwed.
17/09/2025, 14:50 - +44 7958 612614: and I love this liminal period - univerisities are still running their useless courses, kids are still attending and yet - it makes zero sense.  You can’t stop it though, but won’t help anyone in future
17/09/2025, 14:51 - Will-hazzer777: That didn't last long.
17/09/2025, 14:51 - +44 7958 612614: life is pretty good

17/09/2025, 14:52 - +44 7958 612614: they still love each other - it’s just a different kind of love now.  They love each other toxically
17/09/2025, 14:52 - Will-hazzer777: TBF people have always done useless courses and probably always will.
17/09/2025, 14:52 - +44 7958 612614: what’s wrong with you - spending all day chatting
17/09/2025, 14:52 - +44 7958 612614: you still have a roof over your had and regular meals
17/09/2025, 14:53 - Will-hazzer777: Bad romance

17/09/2025, 14:53 - +44 7958 612614: they love each other’s disease
17/09/2025, 14:53 - +44 7958 612614: oh, well - it’s not gonna get much better on average
17/09/2025, 14:54 - +44 7958 612614: I have a meeting now, speak later

17/09/2025, 20:51 - +44 7958 612614: is that a story you wrote?  a catchy plot…
17/09/2025, 21:53 - +44 7516 029853: I was hit by a car while riding a bike. I was sober
17/09/2025, 21:54 - +44 7516 029853: Afraid of them since then (it was quite a clash)
17/09/2025, 21:55 - +44 7516 029853: But have huge respect towards those who weren't hit and/or still aren't afraid.

Those who are attractive and not too traumatised, tend to be those who can actually have a normal conversation.
On the flip side, insecure and not very attractive guys are often spiralling, only reinforcing their troubles

22/09/2025, 19:25 - +44 7516 029853: One would assume that it's obvious that if one cannot rely on looks, they would double down on their personality, instead most of them are bitter and blaming "shallow" women, as well as feminism
22/09/2025, 19:49 - onur: Yeah exactly

22/09/2025, 20:31 - +44 7516 029853: I wonder how they can escalate it further after Hitler and WW2. They have concerned themselves from the beginning 🫣

Both influence each other, to the observer.
23/09/2025, 08:22 - +353 89 605 0161: I actually noticed this as it was happening a few months ago.

I go to a monthly book club and there's a guy there I tend to get on with. This book seemed to have riled him up this month however, and I found him to be very antisocial to a lot of the others there as well as very resistant to engaging with the book we'd read.

Anyway, whether he was right or wrong, I was put off by his behaviour and I noticed very clearly that I was finding his face more and more off putting. To the point that, for a moment, I wondered if I was hallucinating as his expressions started looking almost demonic.

I was also recovering from being very ill the previous days so maybe my fevered brain really was messing with my perception 😅 <This message was edited>
23/09/2025, 08:43 - +44 7516 029853: That effect is strong as well. I remember a few instances when a highly attractive guy would display some disturbing traits and his attractiveness dropped in my eyes. I knew it was my perception, but I just couldn't see him the same way.
23/09/2025, 08:45 - +44 7516 029853: What's interesting, it's proven that if relationships start from friendship and develop over time, the respective attractiveness level tends to correlate much less than if relationships weren't slow burning. 
I find it to be true

Everyone's just jumped on the AI band wagon, to everyone's detriment imo, and the lowest rung of the career ladder's been removed.

Finding a job has been too difficult for decades anyway. Being unemployed is a full time gig.
Having a job is less work than trying to get one.

I don't see it getting any better.

24/09/2025, 11:02 - Will-hazzer777: You do know the difference between average and median.

The median is the middle salary. The average is the mean... So the mean is typically higher than the median.
24/09/2025, 11:03 - Will-hazzer777: This shows the median
24/09/2025, 11:03 - Will-hazzer777: This also shows another estimate of the median.
24/09/2025, 11:04 - Will-hazzer777: This is data from many years ago now... It's not £33k anymore.

24/09/2025, 11:10 - Will-hazzer777: I agree with your agreement entirely. Though that being said a lot of companies hiring managers look abroad almost as first port of call without really taking the time to look internally, either because they already have someone in mind or because they want to hire people from their home country etc.
24/09/2025, 11:11 - +353 89 605 0161: Where do you get that from?

24/09/2025, 11:11 - Will-hazzer777: They'll do it for a member of their tribe.
24/09/2025, 11:11 - Will-hazzer777: Especially a family member

24/09/2025, 11:14 - onur: I can guarantee there isn’t a situation like that within turkish community, like they are not going to sponsor you just because you are turkish xD
24/09/2025, 11:15 - Will-hazzer777: Unfortunately there are lots of fake jobs out there... Or jobs where it's being advertised because they have to because it's the law but they have no intention of giving it to an applicant.

24/09/2025, 11:18 - onur: There was an agreement between turkey and the Uk
24/09/2025, 11:18 - onur: They ended it back in 2022
24/09/2025, 11:18 - onur: Its not sponsor

24/09/2025, 11:24 - onur: Maybe more
24/09/2025, 11:25 - onur: I only came across 1 turkish guy in a lead position in meta and he didnt really help me with the job 😃😃
24/09/2025, 11:26 - onur: 0 indians or pakis or etc
24/09/2025, 11:26 - onur: Idk maybe its my sector
24/09/2025, 11:27 - onur: And when it is a regular british candidate vs a sponsored person
24/09/2025, 11:27 - onur: They always pick a brit why would they pay more?
24/09/2025, 11:28 - Will-hazzer777: I've seen enough cases of nepotism in my time and at different organisations to realise that it happens at enough scale but not so much that it's common knowledge.

Sometimes it's about getting to know your colleagues and finding out basic details like their culture, when they started in the team and often it comes out that such and such is their cousin or niece, or they go to the same place of worship etc... so then it all makes more sense that it's one thing than another.

People who are single children and have no cousins, which is becoming increasingly common, won't understand what's going on. <This message was edited>

24/09/2025, 11:31 - Will-hazzer777: It doesn't work like that
24/09/2025, 11:33 - Will-hazzer777: It depends on the sector.
24/09/2025, 11:33 - +353 89 605 0161: Anecdotal then. Not a bad jumping off point but you're too confident if this is your evidence bromigo.

"In my time" you're 38 🤣
24/09/2025, 11:33 - Will-hazzer777: So? That's good enough..
24/09/2025, 11:34 - Will-hazzer777: I think it's a fair enough sample

24/09/2025, 11:38 - +44 7516 029853: I am not even a good representative of the female kind, I think
24/09/2025, 11:39 - Will-hazzer777: Might be in some ways, but surely not in most ways.
24/09/2025, 11:40 - +353 89 605 0161: Y tho?

24/09/2025, 11:43 - +44 7516 029853: I did not have a normal female socialisation during my formative years, like the vast majority of women do, due to some serious reasons. 
So I am more like a hybrid.

24/09/2025, 11:50 - Will-hazzer777: WhatsApp maxxing.
24/09/2025, 11:51 - Will-hazzer777: What's a rube?
24/09/2025, 11:51 - +353 89 605 0161: He has to import the videos from UK because the racism has outpaced actual immigration to Ireland.
24/09/2025, 11:51 - Will-hazzer777: It's not racism, it's ethnocentrism....it's different.

24/09/2025, 11:53 - Will-hazzer777: Well based on the other definition 95% of the planet is racist.
24/09/2025, 11:53 - onur: Yeah they call it networking 🤣

25/09/2025, 13:55 - +44 7958 612614: I’m sure this is the answer to something - we only need to formulate the question
25/09/2025, 13:58 - +44 7958 612614: I think that all loners should get together and live in a huge community where they can indulge their solitude with others
25/09/2025, 13:59 - +44 7958 612614: lol, imagine a communal dinner of loners where no one says hello or interacts with others.  Just the sound of forks hitting the plate
25/09/2025, 14:00 - +44 7958 612614: maybe they’d get into a rhythm to minimise the din
25/09/2025, 14:01 - +44 7958 612614: then they all queue in silence to wash their own plate before running back to their lairs
25/09/2025, 14:02 - +44 7958 612614: to continue plotting how to get rid of everyone else...
25/09/2025, 14:02 - +44 7958 612614: that’s enough, I want to apologise to all loners here, no offence meant, it’s just the way of a loner
25/09/2025, 14:10 - +353 89 605 0161: I'm at risk of going to a silent retreat sometime in the next couple of years.
I'll let you know.
Cutlery scraping and chewing noises I imagine.
25/09/2025, 14:10 - +353 89 605 0161: Maybe the odd fart too
25/09/2025, 14:16 - +44 7516 029853: > going to a silent retreat 
Why would you do that? Unless it was a joke I didn't get

If you're just supposed to be alone with your thoughts it'll essentially be self harm 😵
25/09/2025, 14:19 - +44 7516 029853: Exactly!
25/09/2025, 14:20 - +44 7516 029853: You can take a break in socialising for a week instead. Does it count as a silent retreat?
25/09/2025, 14:23 - +353 89 605 0161: There must be more too them. Being out and away from man made noise  might be part of it too.

Someone here must have done one before?
25/09/2025, 14:24 - +44 7958 612614: that’s different.  I know people who’ve done it.  Being a loner (27 years) and a week of silent retreat are different things
25/09/2025, 14:25 - +353 89 605 0161: They are!?
All I wanted from it was the experience of being a loner for 27 years 😞
25/09/2025, 14:25 - +44 7958 612614: I’m quite sensitive to other people’s “mindless” noise.
25/09/2025, 14:26 - +44 7958 612614: you’re talking about a fast-tracked process. that costs more
25/09/2025, 14:26 - +353 89 605 0161: Sniffing and shuffling about kind of noises?
25/09/2025, 14:26 - +44 7516 029853: I wonder how he was capable of keeping up for 27 years alone. I am sure I would go mental in just 2 weeks alone
25/09/2025, 14:26 - +44 7958 612614: no, no, no … aggressive noises that people make because they are scared.  I can sniff people’s fear …

25/09/2025, 14:28 - +44 7958 612614: oh, what I can’t stand is when people go to a quiet concert and start talking loudly to each other.  Again, a repressed behaviour - self-medicating by getting on other people’s nerves
25/09/2025, 14:29 - +44 7958 612614: OMG - my vigilantism presentation is tomorrow - I’m tired of looking at this thing 🙁
25/09/2025, 14:29 - +44 7516 029853: I was very surprised to discover that it's quite popular in Berlin to talk out loud in the movie theatres. I can't stand it
25/09/2025, 14:30 - +44 7516 029853: But still it's much better than 2 weeks fully alone
25/09/2025, 14:31 - +353 89 605 0161: Unless you're speaking to me, I'll be annoyed if I can actually discern what you're saying.
In a quiet theatre, on a busy street. If it's loud enough to carry further than the person you're addressing, it annoys me 🤣 <This message was edited>
25/09/2025, 14:31 - +44 7958 612614: maybe you take some drugs to find deep introspection interesting.  Like watching the texture of bark or counting scales along the length of a single hair
25/09/2025, 14:32 - +44 7958 612614: i always try not to come across as aggressive when I challenge them - never works…
25/09/2025, 14:33 - +44 7958 612614: especially when I’m covertly recording the concert...
25/09/2025, 14:33 - +44 7516 029853: Fuck deep introspection
25/09/2025, 14:33 - +44 7516 029853: Overrated
25/09/2025, 14:33 - +44 7516 029853: Pretentious
25/09/2025, 14:33 - +44 7516 029853: Boring
25/09/2025, 14:33 - +44 7958 612614: no shame asking for little help..
25/09/2025, 14:33 - +353 89 605 0161: Screaming? Gasping?
Or less literal?
25/09/2025, 14:34 - +44 7516 029853: I am sure he makes British passive-aggressive noises <This message was edited>
25/09/2025, 14:34 - +44 7958 612614: no, finding comfort in hearing themselves talk at elevated volume - a bit like making noises in the forest to scare the bear
25/09/2025, 14:34 - +353 89 605 0161: Depending on the people's personality, you could probably shut then up quickest by joining in on the conversation. Especially if they're British <This message was edited>
25/09/2025, 14:35 - +44 7958 612614: lol, true, but…
25/09/2025, 14:35 - +353 89 605 0161: Works for public displays of affection too
25/09/2025, 14:36 - +44 7958 612614: it’s usually the quiet types and when they get together - they make this exaggerated display of faked exhuberance
25/09/2025, 14:36 - +44 7958 612614: they are probably enjoying the moment - like dogs when seeing the snow for the first time
25/09/2025, 14:37 - +44 7958 612614: or kids running along the sea dodging waves
25/09/2025, 14:37 - +44 7958 612614: that’s repressed merry making - like we have repressed sexuality in the context of British culture
25/09/2025, 14:37 - +44 7958 612614: carry on films
25/09/2025, 14:38 - +44 7958 612614: that just reminds me - I rarely get annoyed by women - they don’t have the same type of insecurities
25/09/2025, 14:40 - +44 7958 612614: but I suppose with men becoming more feminine - they’ll become more relaxed in their (smooth and body-creamed) skins
25/09/2025, 14:41 - +44 7958 612614: any men here who shave other body parts than faces?
25/09/2025, 14:42 - +44 7958 612614: oh, I was reading about this new trend of deodorising the entire body, amazing!
25/09/2025, 14:42 - +44 7516 029853: I don't think men are becoming more feminine, it's an outdated view. 
I think they are more emotionally evolved and attuned, not feminine
25/09/2025, 14:43 - +44 7958 612614: they are becoming more effeminate because that makes them better at getting through and getting on in life.
25/09/2025, 14:43 - +44 7958 612614: the ones who are not - they are certainly not alpha males - but repressed ones
25/09/2025, 14:46 - +44 7516 029853: > alpha males

gosh 🥲
25/09/2025, 14:46 - +44 7516 029853: and this
> effeminate
25/09/2025, 14:49 - +44 7958 612614: because alpha males are not insecure - therefore they can experiment with emerging paradigms…
25/09/2025, 14:49 - onur: Wtf
25/09/2025, 14:49 - +44 7958 612614: conservatism is steeped in insecurity - not wanting to let go because they cannot compete anymore

I love genuine leather (no, I feel no remorse). I even had a skirt made of real leather, though it is so impractical (almost like wool) that I gave up.

02/10/2025, 12:06 - +44 7958 612614: For real afficionados - it’s leather knickers that counts
02/10/2025, 12:08 - +44 7958 612614: Most stuff that I have is leather, because it’s durable and practical and looks clean - but I always think that artistically it’s a bit vulgar.
02/10/2025, 12:09 - +44 7516 029853: It is incredibly practical. I even learned how to fix and revive real leather (it is quite simple).

It can be vulgar, but rarely. Faux leather is vulgar by default

09/10/2025, 17:34 - onur: Best drink in the world
09/10/2025, 17:34 - +44 7516 029853: I dislike soft drinks with sweeteners instead of sugar
09/10/2025, 17:34 - onur: Regular coke doesnt taste very good
09/10/2025, 17:34 - +44 7516 029853: black bean juice is the best drink
09/10/2025, 17:35 - +44 7516 029853: aka coffee
09/10/2025, 17:35 - onur: I dont have a problem with artificial or regular sugar
09/10/2025, 17:35 - onur: For me its about the taste
09/10/2025, 17:35 - onur: Pepsi max and diet coke are the best
09/10/2025, 17:35 - onur: Coffee is good too, on par with coke
09/10/2025, 17:36 - onur: But since I am smoking cold drinks feel better

09/10/2025, 17:37 - onur: But still funny that it got viral
09/10/2025, 17:38 - +44 7516 029853: why do people care about the mess? 
I am not messy myself, so I do not pay attention to other's mess, unless in a dating context
09/10/2025, 17:39 - Will-hazzer777: It's probably because it's something that annoys me about myself sometimes...
09/10/2025, 17:40 - onur: Same
09/10/2025, 17:40 - onur: But if its dating context its kind of red flag
09/10/2025, 17:41 - onur: But sometimes my room is messy too
09/10/2025, 17:41 - onur: Idk one could at least tidy their room when there is a guest especially dating context

09/10/2025, 19:09 - onur: isn't this itself an idealised version of love?
09/10/2025, 19:09 - onur: :D

09/10/2025, 20:36 - +44 7446 051842: If someone who is messy cleans their room up for my visit, it’s a huge green flag. My girlfriend is a little bit of a messy pup sometimes.
09/10/2025, 20:37 - +44 7446 051842: My aesthetic is more like mercury, a more metallic organized aesthetic.

09/10/2025, 20:40 - +353 89 605 0161: Messy rooms = red flag.

Messy people who can never find stuff, rooting around getting stressed, can't leave the house without being in a strop cause they've been rushing for the last hour.
Going out with someone messy, not a deal breaker but it is an extra level of stress tbh.

11/10/2025, 14:42 - Will-hazzer777: If the don't believe in secularism they have either not been introduced to it or they already believe it's a fake system.
11/10/2025, 14:43 - Parag-meetup: So there are some people who do actually believe in secularism even after one minute of thinking
11/10/2025, 14:45 - Will-hazzer777: They don't no... They like the idea of it because they believe it's a way for them to impose non-secular ideas upon others in the guise of secularism.

11/10/2025, 18:34 - onur: Secularism is fine but preaching should be banned
11/10/2025, 18:34 - onur: And also religious education in the curriculums
11/10/2025, 18:42 - Will-hazzer777: Preaching what?
11/10/2025, 18:44 - Will-hazzer777: The only thing you get is religion masquerading as  other ideologies.
11/10/2025, 18:44 - Will-hazzer777: Secularism mean non-religious not anti-religious.
11/10/2025, 18:46 - Will-hazzer777: And finding the space between religion and anti-religion and between the religions where everyone agrees to be secular is impossible because in reality very few people are neither religious nor anti-religious.
11/10/2025, 18:48 - Will-hazzer777: People's biases always wash through... people don't believe in secularism enough...
11/10/2025, 19:52 - onur: Religions
11/10/2025, 19:52 - Will-hazzer777: Why specifically religions?
11/10/2025, 19:52 - onur: Its not finding the middle
11/10/2025, 19:53 - onur: Its just everyone keeping it to themselves <This message was edited>
11/10/2025, 19:54 - onur: And we’ll be fine
11/10/2025, 19:54 - onur: U know
11/10/2025, 19:54 - onur: Its not that complicated
11/10/2025, 19:54 - Will-hazzer777: How about being anti-religious? Can atheists keep it to themselves?
11/10/2025, 19:54 - onur: Yeah
11/10/2025, 19:54 - onur: :D
11/10/2025, 19:54 - Will-hazzer777: I don't think they can.
11/10/2025, 19:54 - onur: Dont worry about them
11/10/2025, 19:54 - onur: Everybody worry about themselves
11/10/2025, 19:55 - Will-hazzer777: I think they confuse being secular with it being okay to be anti-religious
11/10/2025, 19:55 - +44 7446 051842: Not me.
11/10/2025, 19:55 - Will-hazzer777: Ahh well that's also an impossibility.

11/10/2025, 19:55 - Will-hazzer777: Not possible...
11/10/2025, 19:55 - +44 7446 051842: Until it isn’t.
11/10/2025, 19:56 - +44 7446 051842: People do hate on religion far too much.
11/10/2025, 19:56 - Will-hazzer777: But also it's not been demonstrated why religion should specifically be kept out of public discourse?
11/10/2025, 19:57 - +44 7446 051842: I wept in British.
11/10/2025, 19:57 - +44 7446 051842: Religion can’t escape discourse.
11/10/2025, 19:57 - +44 7446 051842: It should probably just not be directly inserted into law.
11/10/2025, 19:58 - Will-hazzer777: But it's impossible
11/10/2025, 20:02 - Will-hazzer777: People's personal perspectives are coloured by their religious backgrounds or antithesis towards faith whether or not any pseudo-secularist believes it is or not.
11/10/2025, 20:06 - Parag-meetup: And you think people’s perspective should frame laws , and not what’s good for them ?
11/10/2025, 20:15 - +44 7446 051842: I definitely agree, but the law ought not to be ‘The bible + extra.’
11/10/2025, 20:16 - +44 7446 051842: No religion should be name dropped.
11/10/2025, 20:44 - +44 7516 029853: Story time.

I was at the Ig Nobel ceremony that year, and the guy was there too.

11/10/2025, 20:53 - +44 7446 051842: Preaching should be banned?!
11/10/2025, 20:53 - +44 7446 051842: What?!
11/10/2025, 21:20 - onur: Yeah
11/10/2025, 21:20 - onur: I mean when you think about it
11/10/2025, 21:20 - onur: Preaching is against secularism
11/10/2025, 21:21 - onur: I think religions should be treated like sex change operations <This message was edited>
11/10/2025, 21:21 - onur: It should be discussed like after 21
11/10/2025, 21:22 - onur: And younger kids shouldnt be though about those
11/10/2025, 21:22 - onur: And if someone after 21 is like i feel like there is something more than this
11/10/2025, 21:22 - +44 7516 029853: 21 is far too late, though
11/10/2025, 21:23 - onur: I want to do research
11/10/2025, 21:23 - onur: Then they can learn
11/10/2025, 21:23 - onur: By themselves
11/10/2025, 21:23 - onur: I dont wanna put a number, it should just be out of the curriculum
11/10/2025, 21:23 - +44 7516 029853: Also, I think it's essential to give knowledge, especially on such an important topic.


Preaching and displaying bigotry is another thing completely <This message was edited>
11/10/2025, 21:24 - onur: If you dont give information about it
11/10/2025, 21:24 - onur: Religions will be weaker

11/10/2025, 21:24 - +44 7516 029853: It should be taught as part of history
11/10/2025, 21:25 - +44 7516 029853: But with a sceptical perspective on each religion
11/10/2025, 21:25 - onur: well u cant go about 3000+ religions
11/10/2025, 21:25 - onur: Its not really necessary
11/10/2025, 21:25 - +44 7446 051842: I think religious education should be mandatory.
11/10/2025, 21:25 - +44 7516 029853: nah, just the main annoying ones
11/10/2025, 21:25 - +44 7446 051842: Not _religious_ education.
11/10/2025, 21:25 - +44 7446 051842: RS.
11/10/2025, 21:26 - onur: If someone is so religious they can just go to their own religion place and practice and learn

11/10/2025, 21:26 - +44 7446 051842: Why?
11/10/2025, 21:26 - onur: Even a broken clock works 2 times a day xd
11/10/2025, 21:26 - onur: Because it is personal belief
11/10/2025, 21:27 - onur: Unless governments are not benefiting off on it
11/10/2025, 21:27 - onur: God forbid
11/10/2025, 21:27 - onur: ;D
11/10/2025, 21:27 - +44 7516 029853: but what they did with churches was undemocratic, we are more or less democrats here, at least can't have the Soviets as the ethics benchmark
11/10/2025, 21:28 - +44 7516 029853: so something more nuanced is required
11/10/2025, 21:28 - onur: Communism and religions are the same so they saw it as an enemy

11/10/2025, 21:28 - onur: Whatever
11/10/2025, 21:28 - onur: i dont care
11/10/2025, 21:29 - onur: I dont understand why it needs to be taught in schools
11/10/2025, 21:30 - onur: Other than government control
11/10/2025, 21:30 - onur: On religion and people
11/10/2025, 21:30 - onur: :D

11/10/2025, 21:31 - +44 7516 029853: undeniably

🧒 Primary / Key Stage 2 (Ages 7–11)

Common texts and themes:

“The Dragon Machine” by Helen Ward – A picture book exploring imagination and friendship.

“The Reluctant Dragon” by Kenneth Grahame – A humorous classic about a friendly dragon and human prejudice; often used to discuss stereotypes and perspective.

“How to Train Your Dragon” by Cressida Cowell – Popular in upper primary; encourages adventure, humour, and creativity in writing.

23/10/2025, 15:36 - Will-hazzer777: Qais Al-Aswad, 26, who is originally from Syria, sexually assaulted three women as he passed them on the same cycle lane in Horley, Surrey in May and June this year.

Al-Aswad, who was staying at the Four Points by Sheraton Hotel at the time, was seen on CCTV footage reaching out with his hand and sexually assaulting his victims as he cycled past.

The assaults all took place while Al-Aswad was travelling to and from the hotel to work at a car wash in London Bridge. 

He approached the first woman after she had left the pub with her mother, 'slapping her bottom from behind' at around 9pm on May 23.

Al-Aswad 'grabbed hold and squeezed' the bottom of a second woman at around 9pm on June 4.

Eight days later on June 12, Al-Aswad passed a third woman on his bike and 'grabbed her crotch and vaginal area' at around 10.45am.

26/10/2025, 10:36 - +44 7958 612614: I agree with your sentiment in general but why do we obsess so much about the perpetrators of societal transgressions.  We seem to fly the flag for the oppressors and not for the victims.  Is that because we assume that the victims are taken care of by the government/system?  This type of disposition I think is some kind of auto-immune illness.  We want people to not hurt each other as a primary effect - all secondary effects are in a different league of concern.
26/10/2025, 10:38 - +44 7958 612614: so that’s my contribution in terms of highlight your cognitive blindspot
26/10/2025, 10:50 - +44 7958 612614: in a way - your “naivity” as being young is determined by your behaviour / actions
26/10/2025, 10:50 - +44 7958 612614: so just because your age expressed as a number of years from your birth
26/10/2025, 10:51 - +44 7516 029853: I also think it's crucial to highlight that teenagers, though struggling with hormones, are not toddlers who are quite incapable of analysing their actions. More than that, they are at the peak of their physical performance, as well as cruelty.

"Here’s a clear, evidence-based summary of who the usual perpetrators of physical or violent crime are in the UK, based on the most recent data (ONS, Home Office, and Youth Endowment Fund reports through 2024–2025).


---

🔹 1. Gender

The vast majority of perpetrators are male.

Around 82–88% of violent incidents (including non-domestic assaults) are committed by men.
(ONS – Nature of Violent Crime in England & Wales, 2020–2024)

In youth offending data, 87% of proven offences by under-18s are by boys.
(Youth Justice Statistics 2023–2024)



🧠 Why this matters:
Men are overrepresented in both violent victimisation and perpetration — especially in the late teens to early 20s.


---

🔹 2. Age

Violence is strongly concentrated among young people, especially late teens to mid-20s.

Perpetrators are most often aged 16–24 or 25–39.

For proven youth offences, the 15–17 age group commits most violent crimes.

For adults, 25–39-year-olds account for about 40% of identified violent offenders.
(ONS 2024; Home Office, Crime Survey for England & Wales)



🧠 Trend:
Violence involvement peaks sharply in adolescence and early adulthood, then declines with age — a well-established criminological pattern known as the age–crime curve.


---

🔹 3. Relationship to victim

In non-domestic violence:

The most common perpetrator is a stranger (about 40–45% of incidents).

The next largest category is acquaintances (friends, colleagues, etc.) — around 35–40%.

Only a small proportion of non-domestic violence is committed by family members.
(ONS, Nature of Violent Crime, YE March 2024)



🧠 Pattern:
Teen and young adult males are often violent towards other young men, usually in public places such as streets, bars, or near schools.


---

🔹 4. Location & circumstances

Most non-domestic violent incidents occur:

In public places (streets, pubs, transport, or outside schools/universities).

At night and often linked to social contexts — alcohol, nightlife, peer conflict.


Alcohol or drugs are involved in roughly 40–50% of violent incidents (varies by survey year).
(ONS, Crime Survey England & Wales, 2023/24)



---

🔹 5. Socio-economic and contextual factors

Perpetrators are more likely to:

Come from areas of higher deprivation.

Have previous contact with the justice system or school exclusion history.

Have experienced violence themselves (victim–offender overlap).
(Youth Endowment Fund, Beyond the Headlines 2025)

26/10/2025, 10:51 - +44 7958 612614: says - you shouldn’t be accountable - doesn’t correspond to actual subjective reality
26/10/2025, 10:52 - +44 7446 051842: I didn’t quite clock, could you rephrase.
26/10/2025, 10:52 - +44 7958 612614: well, theoretically you could have an anomalous todler who could be acting at a very high level of operational evilness and menace 🙂
26/10/2025, 10:53 - +44 7958 612614: ok, you’re trying to debate with Will, but the concern about someone who did something horrible and trying to find “the right level of punishment” is really not a big societal problem.  The big problem is anti-social, anti-normative, illegal behaviour
26/10/2025, 10:54 - +44 7958 612614: the system should know what’s inside and what’s outside of it.  Everything that’s working in the spirit of the system and contributing to it should benefit more from teh system than something trying to destroy it
26/10/2025, 10:55 - +44 7446 051842: It’s a debate actually about whether we should treat children like adults. 
It’s nothing about solving anti-social behavior.
26/10/2025, 10:55 - +44 7958 612614: in what sense treat them like children?  if they do children things - they are children - if they do adult things - they are adults.
26/10/2025, 10:55 - +44 7446 051842: That’s a seperate conversation.
26/10/2025, 10:55 - +44 7446 051842: At a legal level.
26/10/2025, 10:55 - +44 7958 612614: It’s like - a question whether we should treat a flying car as a car or a plane
26/10/2025, 10:56 - +44 7958 612614: it’s a nonsense conversation
26/10/2025, 10:56 - +44 7958 612614: focus on what really matters
26/10/2025, 10:56 - +44 7446 051842: Should we treat migrant children more harshly if they went through puberty early.
26/10/2025, 10:56 - +44 7446 051842: That’s the actual debate.
26/10/2025, 10:56 - +44 7446 051842: I say no.
26/10/2025, 10:56 - +44 7446 051842: Migration rights really matters.
26/10/2025, 10:56 - +44 7958 612614: no, we treat anyone on the basis of how they contribute to the society (or not)
26/10/2025, 10:57 - +44 7958 612614: matters to whom?  The world, as we used to know, is crumbling before our eyes
26/10/2025, 10:57 - +44 7446 051842: Should we deport illegal migrant children?
26/10/2025, 10:57 - +44 7958 612614: why should we?  have they killed, raped someone?  have they been stealing?
26/10/2025, 10:57 - +44 7446 051842: Okay, should we deport illegal migrant adults?
26/10/2025, 10:57 - +44 7958 612614: there are societal norms that we should all abide to
26/10/2025, 10:58 - +44 7958 612614: for what?  have they been killing, raping or stealing?
26/10/2025, 10:58 - +44 7958 612614: i’ve got a meeting in 2 mins
26/10/2025, 10:58 - +44 7446 051842: No. Just for the fact they are undocumented itself.
26/10/2025, 10:58 - +44 7446 051842: Catch you.
26/10/2025, 10:59 - +44 7958 612614: being “undocumented” is bullshit - humans should be able to roam this planet.  Speak later
26/10/2025, 11:01 - +44 7446 051842: Definitely agree, but I’m trying to speak on his terms.
26/10/2025, 11:25 - Will-hazzer777: If we didn't know his chronological age then yes.... Essentially anyone without verification can then claim to be a child.
26/10/2025, 11:28 - Will-hazzer777: No such thing as rights, especially migration rights. <This message was edited>
26/10/2025, 11:29 - Will-hazzer777: Yes
26/10/2025, 11:29 - Will-hazzer777: Yes
26/10/2025, 11:35 - +44 7446 051842: If you can’t figure it out, you should take his word for it.
26/10/2025, 11:36 - +44 7446 051842: It’s better ten men go off too softly, than one child treated too harshly.
26/10/2025, 11:37 - Will-hazzer777: Nope, we can use dental techniques to determine age anyway which are not affected by hormones of puberty. However this was banned because it was showing these men's true age.
26/10/2025, 11:39 - +44 7446 051842: Is that really why it was banned? What was the stated reason.
26/10/2025, 11:40 - +44 7446 051842: For practical legal reasons we should pragmatically act on them as maxims.
26/10/2025, 11:42 - Will-hazzer777: Only if we agree on them, which we don't
26/10/2025, 11:43 - +44 7446 051842: I agree, but I was responding to your use of ‘rights aren’t real’ as an indicator that they don’t matter.
26/10/2025, 12:26 - Will-hazzer777: The Demirjian method found that girls with central precocious puberty had a mean dental age that was approximately 1.3 years older than their chronological age.

So in practice if someone claims to be a child, which I would make the cut off point at 17 or above... Then if the test says they're 17 as opposed to 16 then, I'd be happy to give them the benefit of the doubt...

However when it just boils down to a judge's discretion as to who is it isn't a child without tests, then in my estimation the law is making an ass out of itself, as per usual though.
26/10/2025, 12:34 - Will-hazzer777: Nonetheless, they shouldn't be here anyway, regardless of age. <This message was edited>

27/10/2025, 23:35 - onur: If I was homeless I would join a gym
27/10/2025, 23:36 - onur: Free shower, wifi, plug, a closet, somewhere warm to hang out
27/10/2025, 23:36 - onur: Toilet
27/10/2025, 23:36 - onur: :D
28/10/2025, 00:34 - Will-hazzer777: Nowhere to sleep though... Not sure where the best places to sleep would be though that cost nothing.

Perhaps, becoming nocturnal would pay... I.e. get a tent and sleep during the day when it is a little bit warmer, maybe in a park or something like that. Then use the facilities in the gym after waking and then stay up during the night, when it's cold and find a late night restaurant or facility to hang about in.
28/10/2025, 00:34 - onur: Finding a place to sleep is my next goal 😂
28/10/2025, 00:35 - Will-hazzer777: In theory I think I'd be more comfortable sleeping in a tent in the park during the day than at night.
28/10/2025, 00:35 - onur: The night is dangerous and you cant beg tho
28/10/2025, 00:36 - Will-hazzer777: Night is dangerous... I didn't know begging was part of the lifestyle...
28/10/2025, 00:36 - onur: It kinda is
28/10/2025, 00:36 - onur: :D
28/10/2025, 00:36 - Will-hazzer777: You should have said.
28/10/2025, 00:36 - onur: I just like to think what I would do if I were homeless

28/10/2025, 00:37 - onur: Hahahha
28/10/2025, 00:38 - Will-hazzer777: I've stayed in really cheap hostels before, 12 people to a really cramped room. Four, three tier bunk beds. Was still £15 or something in east London.
28/10/2025, 00:39 - Will-hazzer777: Sleep on benches.
28/10/2025, 00:42 - onur: That sounds cheap
28/10/2025, 00:43 - onur: I mean convenient
28/10/2025, 00:43 - Will-hazzer777: It was... The people seemed okay... Clearly lots of people who had really difficult shift jobs that paid peanuts.
28/10/2025, 00:44 - Will-hazzer777: Some who were clearly high functioning alcoholics
28/10/2025, 00:45 - onur: Uhh

28/10/2025, 00:46 - Will-hazzer777: There was one old guy who must have been 70 or something and I just thought to myself that I would ask him "what the fuck happened to you in your life that you ended up in here?" I can understand struggling younger people but older people? I thought that something must have gone seriously wrong with his fortunes over the years.
28/10/2025, 00:47 - onur: Some people cant just get a break
28/10/2025, 00:47 - Will-hazzer777: He looked like a thin dumbledoor...
28/10/2025, 00:48 - Will-hazzer777: I thought that he must have got a divorce or something and he just didn't have the will to start life again.
28/10/2025, 00:49 - Will-hazzer777: But that was just my imagination.
28/10/2025, 00:49 - onur: Divorce or bankrupcy or an addiction
28/10/2025, 00:50 - onur: Losing a job or parents or kids

29/10/2025, 12:19 - onur: So true with dating apps, matching with people is like 10% of the problem :D
29/10/2025, 12:20 - onur: given that like 70% of males like dont get a match at all
29/10/2025, 12:23 - +44 7446 051842: Lads, don’t go on dating apps, they aren’t good for you! 
Pick up hobbies and meet people you click with.
29/10/2025, 12:24 - +44 7446 051842: Dating apps just like social media are designed to keep you hooked.
29/10/2025, 12:25 - +44 7446 051842: Late stage capitalism to the maximum.
29/10/2025, 12:25 - onur: I mean they can work, I dont agree with this, but yeah
29/10/2025, 12:25 - +44 7446 051842: Love consumerism.
29/10/2025, 12:26 - +44 7446 051842: Go to social events, go outside, make friends have fun.

29/10/2025, 12:28 - +44 7446 051842: 16 probably about 7 or so months ago.
29/10/2025, 12:28 - onur: You are 16 years old?

29/10/2025, 12:29 - +44 7446 051842: Yeah.
29/10/2025, 12:29 - onur: Do you have a natural social circle here aka school etc?

29/10/2025, 12:30 - +44 7446 051842: Yeah I have quite few from my different hobbies.
29/10/2025, 12:31 - +44 7446 051842: I go to an all boys school, where everybody is chopped, so school isn’t really an option to meet people I want to date with.
29/10/2025, 12:31 - onur: Unlucky
29/10/2025, 12:32 - +44 7446 051842: Nah, it’s lucky. Schoolcest is bad.
29/10/2025, 12:32 - +44 7446 051842: People need to go outside.
29/10/2025, 12:32 - onur: I think dating apps and other social media apps helped me a lot after immigrating to another country, u can still go outside while using these apps
29/10/2025, 12:32 - onur: :D
29/10/2025, 12:33 - +44 7446 051842: Yeah I guess.
29/10/2025, 12:33 - +44 7446 051842: But it doesn’t take a wise old wizard to tell you that a company trying to sell you love is probably evil.
29/10/2025, 12:34 - onur: If you see it as a company trying to sell you love yeah I guess :D
29/10/2025, 12:35 - +44 7446 051842: How would you frame it? <This message was edited>
29/10/2025, 12:35 - onur: A tool that could help me
29/10/2025, 12:35 - +44 7446 051842: Someone should create a non-profit organization dating app.
29/10/2025, 12:36 - +44 7446 051842: We shape our tools, then our tools shape us.
29/10/2025, 12:36 - onur: Well yeah about half of the relationships now start from these apps
29/10/2025, 12:36 - onur: So you are basically removing half of the opportunities
29/10/2025, 12:36 - onur: If you dont use 😅
29/10/2025, 12:37 - +44 7446 051842: No, I’m not, everyone is in excess of opportunities.
29/10/2025, 12:38 - +44 7446 051842: Just because half of the relationships start from dating apps doesn’t mean that any opportunities are lost by removing them.
29/10/2025, 12:38 - onur: Yeah I guess
29/10/2025, 12:38 - +44 7446 051842: Unless you are a terminally ill, bed bound hospital patient.

29/10/2025, 12:41 - +44 7446 051842: Some of the best lovers I’ve seen have been exceptionally poor.
29/10/2025, 12:41 - +44 7446 051842: Yeah that is probably a hinderance.
29/10/2025, 12:41 - onur: U can still find love when you are poor, I was talking about this going out freely and not worrying about a thing bit
29/10/2025, 12:41 - onur: 😅
29/10/2025, 12:42 - +44 7446 051842: Oh yeah, definitely.
29/10/2025, 12:43 - +44 7446 051842: If you are lonely, depressed and in a bad place in your life, and you go on a dating app. 
Believe or not, you are going to find similar.
29/10/2025, 12:43 - onur: I havent met a “lonely” woman yet
29/10/2025, 12:43 - onur: But yeah I see what u mean

29/10/2025, 12:44 - +44 7446 051842: What planet are you living on, Mars? Almost everyone in this society is so lonely, isolated and alienated.
29/10/2025, 12:45 - +44 7446 051842: Stuck in their own head.
29/10/2025, 12:45 - +44 7446 051842: And bed.
29/10/2025, 12:45 - onur: Almost everyone or people using dating apps?
29/10/2025, 12:45 - onur: Or they are both the majority
29/10/2025, 12:45 - +44 7446 051842: Both.

29/10/2025, 12:46 - onur: Maybe you are right
29/10/2025, 12:46 - +44 7446 051842: Find someone to be lonely with.
29/10/2025, 12:46 - onur: I mean I cant argue with that, I would say there are people around women all the time, and u could say it doesnt mean they are “lonely”
29/10/2025, 12:47 - +44 7446 051842: There is people around everyone all the time, but everyone is so lonely, because everyone is so terrified of talking to each other.
29/10/2025, 12:49 - Parag-meetup: It does , evil is just a perspective 
And they definitely aren’t 

Self centred yes 
But if they aren’t they wouldn’t survive and can’t perform their prescribed goal - sell love 
And two can’t pay their employees
29/10/2025, 12:50 - Parag-meetup: Where did you pull those stats from ? Happy and socialised people don’t boast about their good life 
Same with happy people 
Unfortunately it drives the media narrative that most people are unhappy
29/10/2025, 12:51 - onur: 😅
29/10/2025, 12:51 - onur: I was evaluating those arguments with a grain of romanticism
29/10/2025, 12:52 - onur: U could really say most people are alienated
29/10/2025, 12:53 - onur: But its not a permanent state of mind of course
29/10/2025, 12:53 - onur: I think most people are alienated from their jobs and responsibilities 😅
29/10/2025, 12:53 - Parag-meetup: Why do you think so ?
29/10/2025, 12:55 - Parag-meetup: Anecdotal ? Data ? Logical deduction ?
29/10/2025, 12:56 - onur: Hmmmmmmm

First I think there is too much information now and everything is compartmentalised so it is getting harder to naturally connect the dots to a bigger picture

Especially in the western culture and the job ethics, you are planning your hours, days and weeks for something that is never enough to not to worry about these anymore 

So people are more detached from their responsibilities and relationships
29/10/2025, 12:57 - onur: I will think of a better answer as well
29/10/2025, 13:07 - Parag-meetup: I couldn’t understand it
29/10/2025, 13:16 - onur: I think there’s too much information now, and everything has become so compartmentalised that it’s harder to naturally connect the dots and see the bigger picture.

Especially in Western culture and work ethics, people plan their hours, days, and weeks around goals that never seem enough to free them from worry.

As a result, they’ve become increasingly detached from their responsibilities and relationships
29/10/2025, 13:16 - onur: Idk if that helps I refined it :D
29/10/2025, 13:18 - Parag-meetup: It’s the same !
29/10/2025, 13:18 - onur: We have this “immersion bias” now 😂 we are too much in it.
29/10/2025, 13:20 - Parag-meetup: Give me an example
29/10/2025, 13:20 - +44 7446 051842: Negativity bias is exceptionally real, I do accept that. Consider it less a statistic and more of a way of helping Onur realise that people may be feeling just like him.
29/10/2025, 13:20 - onur: the more we focus on optimising parts of our lives, the less we perceive life as a whole
29/10/2025, 13:20 - +44 7446 051842: 100%
29/10/2025, 13:20 - onur: Like when I was unemployed
29/10/2025, 13:21 - onur: All of my life was about finding a job
29/10/2025, 13:21 - onur: And now that I found a job, do I get to focus on a broader aspect? Yes. But how much broader it is? I will be worrrying about deadlines pretty soon
29/10/2025, 13:22 - +44 7446 051842: The real statistic is 35%
29/10/2025, 13:23 - Parag-meetup: Why ?
29/10/2025, 13:23 - Parag-meetup: That’s just the Maslow triad
29/10/2025, 13:24 - onur: It happens because modern culture rewards alienation
29/10/2025, 13:24 - Parag-meetup: 35% people are lonely ? Ya I could buy that 
But does loneliness trouble them a lot , I would say less than half of them
29/10/2025, 13:24 - Parag-meetup: How
29/10/2025, 13:24 - Parag-meetup: Why
29/10/2025, 13:25 - +44 7446 051842: I’m gonna be an ass, and say back that up with a source.
29/10/2025, 13:25 - onur: And compartmentalisation
29/10/2025, 13:25 - Parag-meetup: I am agreeing with a stat you stated 
Burden of proof is on you
29/10/2025, 13:25 - onur: Because alienation and compartmentalisation increase productivity for 1 action :d
29/10/2025, 13:25 - +44 7446 051842: I just going to say it’s indeterminate how much it is affecting them.
29/10/2025, 13:26 - +44 7446 051842: They are however feeling lonely.
29/10/2025, 13:26 - Parag-meetup: Comparmalistion to certain extent does 
Alienation over a period of time wouldn’t
29/10/2025, 13:26 - onur: One leads to another
29/10/2025, 13:26 - Parag-meetup: No
29/10/2025, 13:27 - Parag-meetup: Show me how
29/10/2025, 13:28 - +44 7446 051842: The act of attempting to sell love is where the issue is. It’s trying to consumerise a fickle part of the human experience.
29/10/2025, 13:28 - onur: Have u seen severance?
29/10/2025, 13:28 - onur: Tv series
29/10/2025, 13:30 - onur: You are basically dividing your whole personality for these compartmentalised tasks and eventually these selves become alien to each other and to the society that we live in
29/10/2025, 13:30 - onur: I though like Marx established this 200 years ago
29/10/2025, 13:30 - onur: :D
29/10/2025, 13:31 - Parag-meetup: Meh 
It’s trying to make a living and profit whilst doing something good 
Most jobs and industries work like this .
29/10/2025, 13:31 - Parag-meetup: Yes
29/10/2025, 13:31 - onur: Hell, even talking in another language is kind of alienating
29/10/2025, 13:31 - onur: They cant even pronounce my name right
29/10/2025, 13:31 - onur: 😂
29/10/2025, 13:33 - Parag-meetup: It’s fiction and not real 
Are you saying that people have less of a work life balance than they did before 
Or a cognitive dissonance 

Work life balance is a very modern concept and recognising the need of mental health and harmony are too 

Workers in mines and fields didn’t have that ! They were the ones who suffered 

Modern life is so much better in this hat aspect
29/10/2025, 13:34 - Parag-meetup: As in people in 18rh century Britain could pronounce your name right ?
29/10/2025, 13:34 - onur: Its a different struggle
29/10/2025, 13:34 - onur: Tbh I would much prefer a physical job :D
29/10/2025, 13:35 - onur: As soon as I get permanent residency I will switch
29/10/2025, 13:35 - onur: Its not a suffering contest
29/10/2025, 13:36 - onur: I was just explaining how alienation works and leads to not perceiving life as whole since u asked, 18th century miners are not my problem and out of context in this case <This message was edited>
29/10/2025, 13:36 - onur: I didnt claim it was better in the past
29/10/2025, 13:36 - onur: 😅
29/10/2025, 13:37 - onur: especially on that aspect
29/10/2025, 13:37 - Parag-meetup: How ? Working away from family for months or till your health collapses
29/10/2025, 13:37 - +44 7446 051842: I think the concept of work life balance is symptomatic of unfulfilling work.
29/10/2025, 13:38 - +44 7446 051842: Is it doing something good though, are dating apps good for people?
29/10/2025, 13:38 - onur: They could share simiar traits and old jobs also could have some sort of alienation aspect but their struggle was more survival in a literal sense
29/10/2025, 13:38 - onur: And in survival mode u dont really philosophise or u cant produce art
29/10/2025, 13:39 - onur: Can u understand this?
29/10/2025, 13:39 - +44 7446 051842: Is it bad that most jobs and industries are like this? 
Also back that up.
29/10/2025, 13:39 - Parag-meetup: But you are blaming it on modernity 
Which bit of modernity ? 
Having a good work life balance 
Weekends off 
Annual leave , sick leave ? 
Mental health checks 
Office socialisation ? 

Avaialbibty of modern apps like WhatsApp and meet up to communion are with like minded people and people whom you would lose touch with otherwise 

Meet new strangers through dating apps ? 

Learn new stuff through education , attend events ?
29/10/2025, 13:40 - Parag-meetup: Ya , like you didn’t bother about socialisation when you didn’t have a job
29/10/2025, 13:40 - +44 7446 051842: Is modernity not good enough? Sure it may be better than the coal mines but are we comfy with what we’ve got, or should we want more.
29/10/2025, 13:40 - Parag-meetup: Yes ! 
So modern life is better ?
29/10/2025, 13:40 - +44 7446 051842: Modern life is better.
29/10/2025, 13:41 - onur: Were we discussing modern life vs past?
29/10/2025, 13:41 - onur: What did I miss
29/10/2025, 13:41 - onur: Lol
29/10/2025, 13:41 - +44 7446 051842: It’s just not good enough.
29/10/2025, 13:41 - Parag-meetup: Always more 
But which bit of modernity are we criticising here 
Or are we just trying to blame it because we have certain complaints
29/10/2025, 13:41 - Parag-meetup: It never is , it should never be , content people are dead people
29/10/2025, 13:41 - onur: Amazon lay offs 30k people lol
29/10/2025, 13:41 - onur: Wtf
29/10/2025, 13:42 - Parag-meetup: You said modern life has alienated us
29/10/2025, 13:42 - +44 7446 051842: Work life balance, unfufilling work, alienation, dating apps.
29/10/2025, 13:42 - +44 7446 051842: I say we have always been alienated since agriculture began.
29/10/2025, 13:42 - +44 7446 051842: Feudal serfs were alienated.
29/10/2025, 13:42 - +44 7446 051842: That’s just not good enough.
29/10/2025, 13:43 - onur: Yeah so? We discussed a lot of times I never said past was better, one expects continuity :D but still there are issues that modern life brings that didnt exist much in the past
29/10/2025, 13:43 - Parag-meetup: Living with 6 people you don’t like and 1 you like , and that 1 person not coming back after a hunt is not really fun
29/10/2025, 13:43 - onur: Of course 18th century brit wont be able to pronounce my name because I wouldnt have immigrated there
29/10/2025, 13:43 - +44 7446 051842: I think they did exist in the past.
29/10/2025, 13:43 - onur: 😅
29/10/2025, 13:43 - Parag-meetup: Which particular issue
29/10/2025, 13:43 - onur: Yeah for some people to a certain extent
29/10/2025, 13:43 - onur: But now its much more widespread
29/10/2025, 13:43 - +44 7446 051842: I’m not pro hunter gatherer!
29/10/2025, 13:44 - onur: And extreme
29/10/2025, 13:44 - Parag-meetup: So in general we tend to stay alienated 
Modern life is trying to make it better ?
29/10/2025, 13:44 - +44 7446 051842: I’m saying we need to look beyond alienation.
29/10/2025, 13:44 - +44 7446 051842: My claim is that modern life isn’t doing enough.
29/10/2025, 13:45 - +44 7446 051842: I want a good year not a better year.
29/10/2025, 13:45 - onur: Modern life isnt trying to do anything because it is a concept without intentionality
29/10/2025, 13:45 - onur: :D
29/10/2025, 13:45 - +44 7446 051842: Sure.
29/10/2025, 13:45 - +44 7446 051842: Not via Marxism.
29/10/2025, 13:46 - Parag-meetup: So , I agree that city life is more individualistic than village life 
And as more and more people turn urban it’s a feature of itv

But I believe that indidualism is so much better than forced kinship , not only for you but the whole of society
29/10/2025, 13:46 - +44 7446 051842: Tried that.
29/10/2025, 13:46 - onur: We have a lot more information

This is a fact

This is a fact of modern life

It has advantages

It has disadvantages
29/10/2025, 13:46 - Parag-meetup: It’s a product of our interventions 

We intervene to make life better al lathe time
29/10/2025, 13:46 - +44 7446 051842: The fact we have to force brotherhood is the problem.
29/10/2025, 13:47 - Parag-meetup: You have mentioned information a few times 
I am not following how is it affecting our social life
29/10/2025, 13:47 - Parag-meetup: Give me an example 
I don’t see that happening
29/10/2025, 13:48 - onur: Think of it like we are spreaded thin
29/10/2025, 13:48 - onur: Fragmentation of attention and time
29/10/2025, 13:50 - Parag-meetup: You can chose to have lot of information on what you want and choose .. which you couldn’t before and had to gobble up whatever was available
29/10/2025, 13:51 - onur: I cant choose

It’s not easy dating in 2025. And many women feel like there are few good prospects in the current pool of men – with some giving up completely.⁠
⁠
By 2030, 45% of women between 25 and 44 will be single, according to Census Bureau historical data and Morgan Stanley forecasts – the largest share in history.⁠
⁠
Hundreds of those women, from across the US, shared with the Guardian why they were single, how they felt about it and what they would be looking for in a future partner if they were still in the market for one.⁠

I agree with wht Camden said abt work life balance. It's a symptom of unfulfilling work. However we need to distinguish between work we need to do and work tht feels fulfilling. They're not always the same. I remember a story of a company tht implemented AI to replace the workers. The company didn't yet sack their employees. The employees had the choice to come into work or not and they chose to even tho they didn't need to anymore thanks to the AI, jst to satiate their need to feel lke they're contributing. The solution is the Japanese philosophy of Ikigai. It says tht the ideal career covers these needs: You're passionate abt it, you're gud at it, the world needs it, it mkes you money. However wht ppl miss is tht we need as many Ikigai as possible, not jst one. But who's gonna tke out the trash? Who's gonna shovel the shit? Actually a survey I cba to cite said tht many garbage workers feel lke their job is fulfilling. Deadass ppl can grit thru anything if it genuinely contributes to society. And cus no one wants to do anything tht doesn't contribute to society, those jobs don't exist. At least tht's how things would be without money. Ppl will do any stupid shit for money. However passion is still more powerful than money, so I'm personally not too worried. Money is jst a form of power and power is gud or bad depending on who you give it to. So throw money at stuff tht society needs but is still kinda hard to become passionate abt. Altho there's an interesting contradiction I thought of a while ago - If you lke your job you should get paid less. And if you're gud at your job you should get paid more. Cus money, praise, external rewards can be a gud incentive to get ppl started on stuff tht's intrinsically difficult, but once they're gud and passionate, money gets in the way, all they want is feedback. However ppl should be paid based on value, not time. The latter incentivises slacking off, they get paid by jst being there for enough hours. In an ideal world we would pay ppl with feedback for their work and money would be taken care of by the government thru UBI. But I wanna buy a lambo, and a yacht. The government ain't gonna give me tht, they'll only give me wht's essential. And how can I earn money for a yacht if I ain't getting paid with money anymore? No you only get money by starting things tht are difficult, until you become passionate and gud. The ultimate system to get ppl to step outside of their comfort zones. But won't ppl delay getting gud and passionate so to keep getting money? No cus they'll soon get sacked. Anyway in an ideal world, work would be taken care of by robots and/or Brave New World slaves. But wouldn't tht mke humans obsolete? Yesn't. Ppl will instead provide value in ways the robots can't. And for those ppl who can't keep up, Ls man. To wht extent should the government help thm get better at providing value? Tht is the question. I once heard "A civilisation is not a civilisation if it doesn't allow those who don't provide any value to exist." Do with tht wht you will.

@⁨Parag-meetup⁩ @⁨onur⁩ I tried dating apps a while ago whch was a mistake. https://youtu.be/x3lypVnJ0HM?si=MnQ3kcTgC21ZaAnO Ths vid made me realise tht. Goated channel btw I recommend subscribing. Plus I realised I was slowly having misogynistic thoughts. How you gonna get women if you're misogynistic.

Alienation is a feeling frm not being affiliated with a group. Loneliness is a feeling of being incapable of facing the world on your own. Isolation is being alone. I've been isolated for quite a lot of my life but I've never felt lonely. And I'm sure there are many others lke me. If you wanna cure the loneliness pandemic then help ppl foster a growth mindset. I hve no clue how I hve a growth mindset even tho my upbringing wasn't great. Nor hve I read Carol Dweck's book so I can't speak here. Also Camden and @⁨Parag-meetup⁩ pls give me an example of forced brotherhood.

Haybe Cabdiraxmaan Nur, a Somali national who paid €400 (£350) to travel to Britain last year, attacked Gurvinder Singh Johal, 37, with a kitchen knife at a branch of Lloyds Bank in Derby."

Eid Anwar Fathi Najjar, 20, a small-boat migrant who arrived in the UK illegally three years ago, marched the heavily intoxicated woman out of a York nightclub and stopped her trying to escape his clutches by holding her in a “tight grip”, a court heard.

When the woman tried to get a taxi, Najjar frogmarched her in the other direction."

"[A] witness claimed that Albattikhi's brother confided in them that they knew what had happened to Downes. He claimed that Downes had been murdered, and chopped up, and that there had been a lot of blood. The witness had apparently then been threatened not to tell anyone, and later offered "an interest-free £20,000 loan" from Reveshi to keep quiet. However, the witness spoke to the police in December 2004"

"The police investigation brought to public attention what Julie Bindel described in The Guardian as "endemic child sexual abuse" in Blackpool. According to a police report, the employees of 11 takeaway shops in the town centre had been grooming dozens of white girls aged 13–15, giving them cigarettes, food and alcohol for sex. Mick Gradwell, a former detective superintendent with Lancashire Constabulary, told the The Daily Telegraph that the police inquiry into child grooming in Blackpool, Blackburn and Burnley had been "hampered by political correctness". Allegedly this was because the girls were white and the perpetrators non-white."

But years of random acts of violence and terror have turned what should be spaces for everyday pleasures into zones of fear.

This morning a man shouting “Allahu Akbar” drove a car into a crowd on the French holiday island of Île d’Oléron, leaving at least 10 people injured. It was the latest example of something that has become commonplace across Europe, something that our leaders refuse to deal with."

05/11/2025, 16:33 - onur: It applies to almost every country
05/11/2025, 17:17 - Ali: A lot of terror attacks arent classed as terror attacks anymore. Apparently being stabbed on a train isn’t terrifying enough 🫠

a lovely interaction indeed ☺️

05/11/2025, 18:15 - onur: I mean u shouldn’t be non-chalant about them. All of the footage I watched, people don’t care and turn their back and get stabbed.

I think keeping an aggressive stance is the best so you can quickly react if something goes down

Or If you are a woman, again try to change carriages or smth immediately
05/11/2025, 18:15 - onur: It is a fact we need to deal with these days unfortunately

06/11/2025, 10:11 - Will-hazzer777: I put a teaspoon in my hot chocolate before bed... I only found out what was happening 9 hours later when I woke up. It takes 9 hours to kick in.

I'd just need to turn and I wouldn't completely know how I got there... Time was passing very slowly too.

06/11/2025, 10:22 - Ali: I wonder if there’s a way to get the nutmeg into the system quicker.. rather than wait 9 hours
06/11/2025, 10:23 - Will-hazzer777: That's probably where smoking it came from.
06/11/2025, 10:23 - Will-hazzer777: But that'd just create carcinogens

06/11/2025, 10:31 - Will-hazzer777: "Myristicin and elemicin are the primary ingredients in ground nutmeg and thought to be responsible for the psychologic and physiologic effects observed. Myristicin is metabolized in the body to MMDA, a known sympathomimetic with hallucinogenic properties. It also can interact with serotonergic agents due to pharmacologic properties similar to monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs)."

08/11/2025, 23:50 - Will-hazzer777: The brain is just a large biological antenna.
08/11/2025, 23:51 - onur: Where are the signals that it receives
08/11/2025, 23:52 - Will-hazzer777: They're quantum signals that interact with the microtubules.
08/11/2025, 23:52 - Will-hazzer777: And perhaps other organoids
08/11/2025, 23:52 - onur: Who detected those I have never seen

08/11/2025, 23:55 - onur: What this talks about that we receive signals from somewhere and these microtubules are the transmitter of those?
09/11/2025, 00:03 - Will-hazzer777: I don't think the idea is that microtubules transmit anything, they instead interact with quantum phenomena. More like a receiver.
09/11/2025, 00:04 - Will-hazzer777: "The mechanism is held to be a quantum process called objective reduction that is orchestrated by cellular structures called microtubules. It is proposed that the theory may answer the hard problem of consciousness and provide a mechanism for free will. The hypothesis was put forward in the 1990s by physicist Roger Penrose and anesthesiologist Stuart Hameroff; it combines molecular biology, neuroscience, pharmacology, philosophy, quantum information theory, and quantum gravity."
 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orchestrated_objective_reduction# <This message was edited>
09/11/2025, 00:19 - Will-hazzer777: "Roger Penrose's quantum gravity threshold stemming from instability in Planck–scale separations (superpositions) in spacetime geometry. Output states following Penrose's objective reduction are neither totally deterministic nor random, but influenced by a non–computable factor ingrained in fundamental spacetime. Taking a modern pan–psychist view in which protoconscious experience and Platonic values are embedded in Planck–scale spin networks, the Orch OR model portrays consciousness as brain activities linked to fundamental ripples in spacetime geometry."

09/11/2025, 00:19 - onur: 🧐
09/11/2025, 00:20 - onur: Thats not what u said tho
09/11/2025, 00:20 - onur: :D
09/11/2025, 00:20 - onur: How its a receiver
09/11/2025, 00:21 - onur: This doesnt day anything about receiving a signal
09/11/2025, 00:23 - Will-hazzer777: It's my personal simplification... I.e. quantum states are held in the microtubules, but are influenced by non-computable factors embedded in spacetime geometry, which is independently of our brains... I.e. it's a pan-psychist model.
09/11/2025, 00:24 - onur: But thats a weak hypothesis at best :d
09/11/2025, 00:24 - Will-hazzer777: I mean, that's their theory and there's increasing amounts of evidence hinting that they might be right.
09/11/2025, 00:25 - Will-hazzer777: Which would give a window for free will, the soul and life after death.
09/11/2025, 00:26 - Will-hazzer777: All the things people don't like the idea of.
09/11/2025, 00:27 - Will-hazzer777: "An essential feature of Penrose's theory is that the choice of states when objective reduction occurs is selected neither randomly (as are choices following wave function collapse) nor algorithmically. Rather, states are selected by a "non-computable" influence embedded in the Planck scale of spacetime geometry. Penrose claimed that such information is Platonic, representing pure mathematical truths, which relates to Penrose's ideas concerning the three worlds: the physical, the mental, and the Platonic mathematical world. In Shadows of the Mind (1994), Penrose briefly indicates that this Platonic world could also include aesthetic and ethical values, but he does not commit to this further hypothesis."

She hasn't been cancelled at all. Has a new movie out etc...
If someone did that a decade ago the consequences would have been totally different.

I think that's why people are interested in it. Sign of the times kind of thing.
Thays if anyone even is interested tbh, most internet drama is just bots arguing with themselves anyway. <This message was edited>

09/11/2025, 21:34 - onur: U dont have to be cancelled all together, one group could still cancel you from their view or smth its just cancel culture is dying not everybody jumping on board but the effort is still there
09/11/2025, 21:39 - +353 89 605 0161: Nah, it's a state you're in not an effort from some third party.
Saying she's "cancelled by the left" is meaningless.

JK _was_ cancelled, but she's been renewed lol


And cancel culture isn't gone it's just in someone else's hands.

11/11/2025, 10:34 - onur: A meme (MEEM) is an idea, behavior, or style that spreads by means of imitation from person to person within a culture and often carries symbolic meaning representing a particular phenomenon or theme. A meme acts as a unit for carrying cultural ideas, symbols, or practices, that can be transmitted from one mind to another through writing, speech, gestures, rituals, or other imitable phenomena with a mimicked theme.

There was a period in my life when I was certain I had Jewish ancestors.
There was literally none, according to a generic test.
28/11/2025, 00:30 - Will-hazzer777: It's one of those unfortunate things. Especially when one wants to be a part of a strong ethnic and cultural identity, but finds the one one is part of isn't as firm or as interesting as one is taught (or not taught as it might happens) to believe. <This message was edited>
28/11/2025, 00:32 - Will-hazzer777: I'd always admired how strong Scottish identity happened to be when I was growing up. Though I had no Scottish background myself. Similarly I found Jewish religion and religion/ritual intriguing.
28/11/2025, 00:38 - Will-hazzer777: As I've grown older and have had the chance to study Englishness and English identity myself; something that had been stopped from being taught and passed down for ideological reasons. I do see it as a lot richer and deeper and esoteric than I had supposed.

04/12/2025, 18:09 - Will-hazzer777: That means cancelling your own pension too.

“The palm reader was very emphatic about the fact that John would be killed on an island,” the Los Angeles-based radio DJ, 79, told Fox News Digital in an interview published Tuesday.

“When I think of islands, I think of the obvious places surrounded by water, and I was raised in New York. I just never thought of it as an island,” Mintz added."

08/12/2025, 13:48 - Will-hazzer777: "Sadly, this very occurrence was warned to Lennon in the late sixties, after he was given a letter from a psychic who told him an assassination attempt would be made on the Liverpool native if he was in the US.

The letter, which he read out on camera with the BBC whilst sitting beside his wife, said that there would be an ‘attempt to assassinate you' after they allegedly received information during a Ouija board consultation.

Claiming that a spirit called Brian Epstein gave them the information, Ono can be seen laughing with her husband at the note. Epstein was the band’s manager from 61 until his death six years later."

09/12/2025, 23:44 - Will-hazzer777: I think much of this is wishful thinking, especially on the part of the 3M new voters, most of whom are not European and will want to keep the UK out of the EU.
09/12/2025, 23:45 - Will-hazzer777: Similarly I know so many of my male friends who voted to remain, but would have voted to leave if it hadn't been for the fact that they are married or are partnered up with European women.
09/12/2025, 23:46 - Will-hazzer777: If there was another vote, then they would most likely vote to remain out.
09/12/2025, 23:47 - Will-hazzer777: Similarly the polls were wrong in 2016... I can't imagine this one being much more accurate.

10/12/2025, 10:23 - Will-hazzer777: It's not quite a two way street. Especially when a postal vote is involved. At the ballot booth people vote how they wish and tell their partner what they want to hear afterwards. Not so easy with postal votes.

hybrid war techniques right in your face (half-jokingly saying) <This message was edited>
11/12/2025, 17:19 - onur: U know what, it could be that or a freaking rage bait  😅
11/12/2025, 17:20 - +44 7516 029853: true!
and it definitely works as I am still angry lol 😂
11/12/2025, 17:22 - Ali: It’s such a shame England is so low on the list. I actually think we’re massively underrated. Roast dinners have everything needed to feel satisfied!
11/12/2025, 17:22 - +44 7516 029853: I love afternoon teas.
I find them underrated as well
11/12/2025, 17:22 - Ali: Oooo yes!! Definitely
11/12/2025, 17:23 - Ali: Pie, liqor and mash! 🤤
11/12/2025, 17:23 - Ali: Fish and chips!
11/12/2025, 17:23 - +44 7516 029853: Fish pie is 🔥
11/12/2025, 17:23 - Ali: Hungry now 😂
11/12/2025, 17:25 - Ali: USA is basically just everyone else’s food no? Trying to think what they have that is actually theirs… 🤔 burgers? Is that it?
11/12/2025, 17:25 - Ali: Popcorn? Lol
11/12/2025, 17:25 - onur: Yeah USA = fast food
11/12/2025, 17:25 - onur: I guess
11/12/2025, 17:26 - +44 7516 029853: and big portions
11/12/2025, 17:27 - +44 7516 029853: imagine 2 regular-sized dishes served as one - that's the norm
11/12/2025, 17:27 - onur: Like pizza is italian but ny style pizza is USA
11/12/2025, 17:27 - onur: Type shit
11/12/2025, 17:27 - +44 7516 029853: even in cities like SF, NYC, Boston
11/12/2025, 17:27 - Will-hazzer777: I don't like Ethiopian food... It's not my thing at all.
11/12/2025, 17:28 - Will-hazzer777: French is surprisingly good
11/12/2025, 17:28 - onur: Is better than czech :D
11/12/2025, 17:28 - +44 7516 029853: I once went to a mediocre Ethiopian café, but it is usually great
11/12/2025, 17:28 - Will-hazzer777: Italian food is over hyped and can't be eaten more than twice a week at best.
11/12/2025, 17:30 - Will-hazzer777: It wasn't that... It's the bread and the dip stuff... Stoggy stuff mostly lacking flavour. They've perhaps learnt over the years they can't sell traditional Ethiopian food. They need to spice it up to compete.
11/12/2025, 17:32 - Will-hazzer777: Turkish food is very good. Almost can't fault it.
11/12/2025, 17:32 - Will-hazzer777: <Media omitted>
11/12/2025, 17:33 - Will-hazzer777: Czech food is also very good from my experience.
11/12/2025, 17:34 - Ali: Yes, I agree
11/12/2025, 17:35 - Ali: Though I can imagine eating @⁨onur⁩ may be rather too salty ?
11/12/2025, 17:38 - Will-hazzer777: "Injera (fermented teff flatbread) has a sour, spongy texture and aroma that many Western palates find unusual. Fermentation flavors can be interpreted as “off” if one expects neutral bread."

"Early or budget Ethiopian restaurants abroad sometimes downscale spice levels, use poor-quality teff blends, or cut corners to reduce costs or appeal to a broad customer base—producing bland, greasy, or sour-tasting plates."

This was my experience...

Maybe I'm wrong about the lack of flavourful being authentic... I thought it was from discussions with foodie friends of mine...
11/12/2025, 17:38 - Will-hazzer777: Maybe I'll try it again sometime...
11/12/2025, 17:41 - Will-hazzer777: No no..
11/12/2025, 17:42 - Will-hazzer777: "A few months ago, Nigerian migrants housed at a government hostel in Milan suddenly refused to eat any more of the free food on offer. Italian food is monotonous and indigestable, they explained. Then they went berserk.

This was not a one-off case. Far from it. There have been hunger strikes, demos, sit-ins and the odd riot in protest at the stuff. Recently, a group of mainly Pakistani migrants based in a Reggio Emilia hostel were given their own taxpayer-funded chef ‘specializzato in piatti pachistani e africani’. They had complained that Italian food was making them ill."

I understood their pain after spending a week in Rome last year.
11/12/2025, 17:47 - onur: Yeah, you can tbh 🤣
11/12/2025, 17:47 - onur: Lol 😆 I am not sure if they are becoming ill because of the cuisine
11/12/2025, 17:48 - onur: I dont like pork steak too much. And they use that kind of meat a lot with a lot of fat
11/12/2025, 17:48 - onur: They have a good omacka sauce (or smth)
11/12/2025, 17:49 - onur: I spent 6 months in CZ, I struggled a lot with the traditional foods :( but maybe its just me
11/12/2025, 17:51 - onur: Yeah I can see that you can do it wrong easily, and it turns into a bland greasy mush
11/12/2025, 18:55 - onur: https://www.instagram.com/reel/DSF3VRuj-Eg/?igsh=Ym4yeGZuNzlmb244
11/12/2025, 19:52 - Will-hazzer777: That's one of the only downside of Turkish food, no pork or bacon.
11/12/2025, 19:53 - onur: Charcuterie and bacon are cool but I dont like pork meals
11/12/2025, 19:53 - Will-hazzer777: That's what it was... 3 or 4 containers of bland greasy mush with sour flat pancake bread that tastes off.
11/12/2025, 19:54 - Will-hazzer777: Not everything is for everyone... That's why there's diversity..
11/12/2025, 19:55 - onur: Yeah its probably because I am not used to it
11/12/2025, 19:55 - Will-hazzer777: United we stand divided we eat.
11/12/2025, 19:55 - Will-hazzer777: It's probably not just that
11/12/2025, 19:56 - onur: For example I cant eat a quarter pounder either. It tastes and smells too meaty :D Pork is similar, a bit heavy for my palate
11/12/2025, 19:57 - onur: I am talking about a pork steak or a home dish cooked with pork
11/12/2025, 19:57 - onur: Its too fatty as well
11/12/2025, 19:58 - Will-hazzer777: My step-grandmother would make fantastic spicy pork chunks... Magnificent
11/12/2025, 19:58 - onur: This looks good 
Do you eat it with rice?
11/12/2025, 19:58 - Will-hazzer777: Oh yeah good pork dishes usually cut the fat off, unless you want like it.
11/12/2025, 19:59 - Will-hazzer777: Yeah or some kind of unfermented flat bread 😅 could eat it just as is tbh.
11/12/2025, 19:59 - onur: Yeah it looks like it would go well with rice
11/12/2025, 20:00 - onur: I would probably add yogurt as well
11/12/2025, 20:00 - onur: XD
11/12/2025, 20:01 - Will-hazzer777: Yeah, yoghurt makes a good marinade, good with anything tikka... However since I know now about my dairy issues, I know to stay away.
11/12/2025, 20:01 - onur: Yoghurt goes well with everything except for fish

The wanted man was being chased in the town of Galatone, southern Italy, when he tried to trick officers into thinking he was a part of the life-size nativity scene."

16/12/2025, 13:02 - Will-hazzer777: "A recent study found that the Irish names “Niamh” and “Saoirse” were the two most mispronounced words in Britain, ahead of such tongue-twisters as “gyro” and “croissant”, which came third and fifth on the list respectively.

The website Unscramblerer.com analysed search data from Google Trends to find which words most commonly prompted us to look up their pronunciation. To the surprise of, well, probably no one, and certainly not the country’s Niamhs and Saoirses, these two traditional Gaelic names had more people rushing to ask Google “how do I pronounce…?” than any other words."
